```sh
pw build [--debug] [--backend nethttp|fasthttp]
         [--target lambda|azure-functions|google-cloud-run-functions|vercel-go]
```

`pw build` turns the current project state into a release artifact. With no
target it produces the ordinary binary. `--backend` selects the HTTP
implementation and defaults to `nethttp`; `--target` selects provider
packaging.

## What it does

1. runs [`pw generate`](/pw/project/generate/);
2. builds the Tailwind stylesheet **minified**, if Tailwind is enabled — this
   overrides `assets.tailwind.minify`, so a release is never accidentally
   unminified;
3. builds the [asset tree](/guides/frontend/static-assets/) into `dist/public`:
   it converts what the project asked to convert, writes the `*.br`, `*.zstd`
   and `*.gz` sidecars, and emits the manifest that decides every cache header;
4. rejects the build if `project.main` depends on a development-only package;
5. runs `go build` on `project.main` from `popcornwave.toml`.

The binary lands in the project root, named after the main package. The
scaffolded `.gitignore` already excludes it, along with everything under
`dist/` — the built tree, the conversion cache, and the manifest are all build
output.

With `--target`, the result instead lands under
`.pw/build/<target>/<backend>/`. Lambda and Azure Functions receive a Linux
binary plus provider metadata; Google Cloud Run functions and Vercel Go receive
a locally compiled, vendored source tree. See [Serverless Hosting](/guides/deployment/serverless/)
for each artifact contract.

Today, `contrib/devidp` is the only development-only package. It is the identity
provider used by [`pw dev`](/pw/project/dev/), and it signs users in without
checking a password. Linking that behavior into a deployable binary is a build
defect, not a production setting, so `pw build` stops and names the importing
package.

## Debug artifacts

```sh
pw build --debug
```

`--debug` keeps the debug information a deployable artifact otherwise drops: the
source map the script build emits, and the DWARF and symbol table that
`-ldflags=-s -w` removes. Nothing else about the build changes.

Reach for it when a shared test or CD deployment is being debugged by more than
one person. Do not reach for it for staging, which exists to rehearse
production — an artifact that differs from the production one rehearses nothing.

Without it the map is absent, and the bundle carries no `sourceMappingURL`
comment either, because a bundle naming a map the tree does not hold turns every
devtools open into a request for a file that is not there. The two shapes give
the bundle the same hashed name, so the URL a page loads does not depend on which
one produced it. Panic stacks still carry function names and line numbers in both:
`pw build` retains Go's pclntab either way.

`--debug` brings back nothing from [`pw dev`](/pw/project/dev/). The error
overlay, the launcher, and the development identity provider are absent from a
`pw build` artifact of either shape, and step 4 above still refuses a build that
imports one.

## Running the result

```sh
APP_ENV=prod ./myapp
```

`APP_ENV` selects which project-local configuration file is read; see
[Application Configuration](/guides/architecture/configuration/).

## Cross-compiling and TinyGo

`pw build` shells out to `go build`, so the usual environment variables apply:

```sh
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 pw build
```

The generated path uses no runtime reflection, so the same sources can target
TinyGo. `pw build` always links with host `go`, so a TinyGo build runs the
preparation steps and then invokes that compiler itself:

```sh
pw prepare
tinygo build -scheduler=threads -o myapp ./cmd/myapp
```

[`pw prepare`](/pw/project/prepare/) is this command without its final step. Use
it rather than `pw generate`, which writes the generated Go but not
`dist/public` — a directory `public.go` names in a `go:embed` directive, so the
compiler fails on a tree that was never built.

`-scheduler=threads` is required for any engine that speaks a network protocol.
Under the cooperative scheduler a blocking socket call holds the whole runtime,
so a driver's cancellation watcher never runs and a query outlives its context
deadline without reporting one. The `database/postgres` and `database/mysql`
packages refuse to compile without the flag rather than letting that happen at
run time.

[Container Images](/guides/deployment/container-images/) uses both commands in
the two Dockerfiles `pw init` writes.

TinyGo's `net` package has no networking implementation of its own; every socket
passes through a Netdever registered by the program. Projects scaffolded with
TinyGo support include a root `tinygohelper.go` for that registration:

```go
//go:build tinygo

package publicassets

import _ "github.com/shibukawa/tinygodriver/netdev"
```

The `//go:build tinygo` constraint keeps the file out of host Go builds. Without
it a TinyGo binary compiles fine and then exits at startup:

```
2026/01/01 00:00:00 Netdev not set
```

Only a project created with `--tinygo`, or with that wizard answer, gets the
file — it is not the default. Add it by hand before switching a project to
TinyGo.

## In CI

Verify that generated code is current before building:

```sh
pw generate --check
pw build
```
