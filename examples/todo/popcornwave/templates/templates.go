// The runtime it names applies the sections of a page that arrive after the
// rest of it, which is what a template declaring an `async` parameter needs.
// A page without one loads it and finds nothing to do.
//
// The template calls this rather than writing a literal path, because the URL
// carries a revision derived from the script's own bytes: an upgrade that
// changes the runtime changes the URL, and a literal would go on pointing at
// bytes the server no longer serves.
