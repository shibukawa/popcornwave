// Socket is an open typed WebSocket connection. It is the module's own type
// rather than a wrapper around it, for the reason Stream is: the value a
// callback receives here is the value it receives on the other transport
// runtime, so a handler body is the same text on both.
//
// Read decodes one message into In and Write encodes one from Out, each through
// a generated codec. Read must be called from one goroutine; Write may be called
// from any, which is what makes a broadcast goroutine safe.
type Socket[In, Out any] = tinybind.Socket[In, Out]

// SocketOptions configures one socket: the read limit, the idle and write
// deadlines, the ping cadence, the offered subprotocols, and the origin check.
// A zero field takes the process default, and a process default left unset takes
// a concrete value — nothing reaches the connection as zero, because an unset
// read deadline is a read nothing can interrupt.
type SocketOptions = tinybind.SocketOptions

// SetSocketDefaults installs the process-wide socket options. It is shared with
// the other transport runtime, so installing them once covers both.
//
// An origin check installed here replaces this framework's own resolution, on
// both runtimes and for every socket. Leave it unset to keep the resolution
// described on WebSocket.

// WebSocket upgrades the request to a WebSocket, runs fn against a typed
// socket, and closes the socket when fn returns.
//
// The two structs are the protocol: In is what the client sends and Out is what
// this handler answers with, and generation emits a decoder for the first and an
// encoder for the second from the types named in the callback. Neither has to be
// spelled at the call.

//
// The return value is the handshake error and nothing else. A non-nil value
// means the refusal response has already been written as a problem document, so
// the handler logs or counts it rather than answering. fn's own error is raised
// after the connection has been accepted, where no status is left to carry it,
// and reaches the handler installed with SetStreamErrorHandler instead — the
// same sink a stream failure takes, since the two have the same character.
//
// The callback must not read w or r. It runs before this returns here and after
// the handler has returned on the other transport runtime, where the request
// value belongs to whichever request occupies that slot next. Capture what it
// needs — the identity, the peer — before calling.
//
// A handshake from another origin is refused. The comparison is this
// deployment's own, reading the declared proxies and the declared trusted
// origins, so a socket behind a proxy is judged on the origin the browser
// actually used rather than on whatever the proxy put in Host. A request
// carrying no Origin at all is admitted: only a browser is required to send one,
// and refusing its absence would refuse every service and command-line client.
