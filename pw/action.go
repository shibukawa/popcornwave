// The two calls a generated page dispatcher makes.
//
// A page whose template declares a form action registers POST on its own path
// beside its GET, and the generated body reads which server function was
// submitted and runs it. Both halves are named on the framework namespace, so
// generated code calls pw rather than reaching past it into the module — the
// same containment every other generated call already has.

// ActionSelectorField is the hidden field a lowered form carries to say which
// server function a native submit is for.
//
// It is fixed rather than configured. The template compiler writes the field and
// the generated dispatcher reads it, and both take their name from the same
// place, so a project renaming one without the other would produce a form that
// submits to a dispatcher that cannot tell what it received.
const ActionSelectorField = tinybind.DefaultActionSelectorField

// ActionSelector returns the server function selector a native form submit
// carried, or the empty string when it carried none.
//
// The query is read before the body, because a submit button's formaction is
// what carries the selector when one form dispatches to several handlers, and
// that channel has to win over the form's own hidden field rather than merely
// coexist with it.

// DispatchAction runs one server function on the page's own POST route and
// applies the post-redirect-get default.
//
// A handler that writes nothing is answered with a redirect back to the page it
// was submitted from, so a reload does not resubmit and the address bar keeps
// showing the page. A handler that wrote a status, a header, or a body keeps
// exactly that response, which is what lets it redirect elsewhere, render the
// page inline with validation errors, or stream.
//
// The redirect goes through Redirect rather than the module's own, which is the
// one thing this wrapper adds. The runtime posts an intercepted form to this
// same route, so the redirect a silent handler produces is commonly answered to
// a fetch — and a fetch follows a 303 and would apply a whole page where a
// region set belongs. Redirect already branches on that, so routing through it
// means a scriptless submit and an intercepted one reach the same handler and
// each gets the answer its own client can use.

// a handler needs no flag and no framework type to choose between answering and
// letting the default redirect stand.

// It counts the headers present before the handler ran, so a header a
// middleware installed is not mistaken for one the handler wrote.

// ActionDeclaration is what ServerAction returns. It carries nothing: the value

// ServerAction declares that fn is a server action reachable from a component
// script, whatever its signature.
//
// A handler-shaped function is an action by existing, because that shape is
// unambiguous. An arbitrary signature distinguishes nothing, since every
// function has one, so something outside the signature has to say which
// functions are actions. That is the whole of what this does.
//
// Write it at package level, beside the function:
//
//	var _ = pw.ServerAction(GetUser)
//
//	func GetUser(ctx context.Context, id string) (User, error) { … }
//
// A script reaches it as actions.getUser, the Go name in initialism-aware
// lowerCamelCase. Pass a name to override that: it is a wire name rather than a
// second identity, so a Go rename moves the address and leaves it where it is.
//
// It is spelled here rather than left at the module's own because a page tree's
// templates, reserved paths and generated files are all this framework's, and a
// project should not import a second module to declare one.
