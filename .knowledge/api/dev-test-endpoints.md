title: Development Test Data Endpoints

The pwdev application serves dataset seeding and assertion over its own listener so an external test process (decision:browser-suite-seeding) reaches the running pool without a subprocess or a second connection.

```yaml
package: github.com/shibukawa/popcornwave/pw (devtest_mode_dev.go, pwdev build tag)
surface:
  - POST /_pw/test/seed/{dataset}   -> 204, or 404 unknown dataset, 400 invalid name, 500 apply failure
  - GET  /_pw/test/assert/{dataset} -> 204 match, 409 with text/plain per-table diff, 404/400/500 as above
locks:
  - pwdev build mode; the release stub returns the chain untouched and links no seeding code
  - data:runtime-environment must resolve to development, matching policy:devidp-safety allowlisting
  - loopback RemoteAddr with no forwarding header, no opt-out
placement:
  - wraps the finished middleware chain in buildMiddlewares, above the closed /_pw reserved namespace
  - absent from the api:test-run bridge chain, which builds its own handler
  - unclaimed /_pw/test paths still fall to the namespace 404, so absence is indistinguishable from a release build
resolution:
  datasets: data:seed-dataset names under testdata/seed, subdirectories allowed, extension optional
  containment: a name resolving outside the seed directory is refused 400; the mux path-cleaning is the first layer
  pool: middleware.rdb migration group from data:middleware-runtime-config, same routing as api:cli-seed
  dialect: from the migration group DSN scheme via internal/dbseed (decision:dbtestify-integration)
semantics:
  seed: dataset _operation blocks apply; default clear-insert per named table
  assert: pool state only; there is no test transaction here, unlike api:test-seed
non_goals:
  - dataset listing or upload; files stay version-control owned
  - authentication; the three locks are the whole admission rule
```
