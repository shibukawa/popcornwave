title: pwfast Runtime Package
---
pwfast is the pw surface over a fasthttp request, the second half decision:transport-source-transform imports in place of pw when it rewrites a handler.

```yaml
package: github.com/shibukawa/popcornweb/pwfast
serves: requirement:pw-call-registration, whose second-package clause this is
status: implemented 2026-08-10, against tinybind-go v0.5.1
shape:
  names: identical to the pw counterpart, so a rewritten call selector is unchanged and only the import line moves
  parameter: the request value first, named r, matching what the upstream emitter prints for this transport
  untagged: no build constraint, because only application files are tagged; a library behind one is invisible to an untagged go vet, go test, and gopls run
  transport: github.com/shibukawa/tinygodriver/fasthttp, the fork fasthttpbind itself uses, so the request type is one type rather than two that agree
implemented:
  bind: Parse
  api: WriteAPI and WriteAPIStatus
  problem: WriteProblem, whose document is byte-compatible with the net/http half
  html: WriteHTML, WriteHTMLPage, WriteHTMLChain, and WriteHTMLFragment
  problem_constructors: the pwruntime set, re-exported so a rewritten call finds the same names
  registration: RegisterHTMLDocument and RegisterHTMLErrorPage, reaching the one registry of decision:shared-runtime-leaf
  stream: WriteStream and SetStreamErrorHandler
  update: WantsUpdate, WriteUpdate, WriteUpdateNavigate, Redraw, RedrawComponents, Replace, and RegisterReloadable
  streaming: ServeUpdate for a streamed navigation over the same module entry the net/http half calls, and ServeLive over the shared protocol of decision:shared-runtime-leaf
  render_bounds: the async timeout and concurrency travel with the published settings, so a boundary is settled on the terms the deployment chose rather than on a default this half invented
  update_configuration:
    problem: every entry needs composed options built from this framework's own config type, which is bound by generated configbind code inside pw and cannot be named from here
    solved_by: the resolving runtime publishes what it resolved as a transport-free settings value in pwruntime, and this half reads it
    why_that_is_right: a settings file is not a transport concern, so the transport that read it and the transport that serves the request need not be the same one
    disabled: absent settings mean nothing enabled updates, and every entry treats that as not-an-update rather than as an error
  shared_types: the composition types are htmlbind's, aliased rather than redeclared
  problem_alias_was_wrong:
    found: 2026-08-09; a first draft aliased the module's two-field problem body under the name pw gives its own richer application-facing struct, so one name meant two types
    fixed: decision:shared-runtime-leaf shipped, and both halves now alias one declaration
buffered_render:
  fact: the chain renders into a buffer and commits after it succeeds, where the net/http half can stream
  why: committing first would trade a problem response for a half-written page, and the streaming path needs the flusher the deferred htmlupdate port holds
  cost: time to first byte, not bytes
live_converged_2026_08_10:
  first_cut_withdrawn: it called the module's live entry, which has none of the admission bound, watchdog, digest suppression, boundary bound, or close reasons the net/http half layers on, so it would have served a poorer stream with nothing to report the difference
  then_done_the_other_way: the protocol moved into the leaf, and both halves now read one set of decisions rather than two readings of the same document
  what_moved: the close reasons and media type, the lifetime jitter and watchdog, the per-client admission count, the keyed delivery digest and its per-process fallback, the manifest parse, and the four record writers
  what_each_runtime_keeps: setting response headers, obtaining a writer that flushes, naming the client for admission, and answering a pre-commit failure
  one_real_difference: the fasthttp body writer runs after the handler returned, so the loop reads nothing from the request value and is bounded by the watchdog rather than the request context; a client going away is noticed on the next write, which is the signal the other half falls back to once a record fails
chain_completed_2026_08_10:
  bootstrap: Middlewares, Run and Serve; Middlewares assembles the request path only, because framework initialization is transport-free and a deployment runs it once on whichever runtime binds configuration
  refuses_without_settings: composing from zero values would give a chain with no recovery frame, no request ID and no security headers, which serves requests and looks like a chain
  routing: ServeMux translating Go 1.22 patterns onto the vendored trie router, per api:serve-mux
  frames: resources, client address, request ID, access log, recover, security headers, request timeout, max request body, public assets, session, CSRF, operational probes, API documentation, guard, and tracing
  what_is_shared_rather_than_copied:
    - the slot numbers and the composition, because a chain running in a different order on one transport is a different application
    - the session resolution, because two implementations of when a token rotates are two chances to leave one valid that should have ended
    - the origin comparison, the path canonicalisation, and the include-over-exclude precedence, each of which fails by accepting a request it should have refused
    - the static asset path check, because two implementations of which names may be served are two chances to serve one that must not be
    - the span query redaction, because a trace backend is retained longer and read more widely than the application database
    - the readiness probe, because readiness is a fact about the process rather than about the request that asked
  value_propagation: RequestCtx.Value answers from the store SetUserValue writes to, so every reader in the shared leaf already worked and only the write side needed anything
  differences_recorded_rather_than_smoothed:
    request_timeout: the other half deadlines the request context and everything downstream observes it; here the bound is the transport's, 408 to the client with the handler goroutine running to completion
    recover: this half recovers more completely, because the response is buffered and a failed handler's partial body is still discardable
    uri_normalisation: fasthttp normalises the request URI before a handler sees it, so a dot-segment path never reaches the asset check and misses the mount instead
    header_case: the two canonicalise header names differently, Etag against ETag, which is why the shared test seam reads them case-insensitively
identity_endpoints_2026_08_11:
  where: popcornweb/plugin/auth/authfast, not here, because they belong to the plugin that owns the decisions rather than to the transport runtime
  what_moved_instead: plugin/auth grew auth.Exchange, a transport seam, and every endpoint body was rewritten against it; both transports now drive one implementation of the login
  this_half_supplies: pwfast.GuardPolicy, which RuntimeOptions already took, plus the Extra frame slot the authentication step is positioned in
  no_second_login: two implementations of when a transaction cookie is consumed, or of which failures answer 403 rather than 400, would be two chances to leave a hole in one of them
  covered: authfaste2e drives the OIDC round trip and the passkey ceremonies against a real provider and a real database, and authfastjwte2e drives the bearer mode; an agreement test asks both listeners the same question and compares status, body and headers
  found_by_the_agreement_test: Redirect wrote no fallback body here, because this transport reports a default content type where net/http reports none, so the check for an unset one was never true
absent_and_why:
  everything_absent_here: is absent rather than stubbed, per policy:absent-rather-than-stubbed
  extension_registry:
    none: an imported capability installs no frame here; the Extra frames of RuntimeOptions are the plugin seam, positioned by the same slot numbers, and the application names them
    still_the_reason: a plugin's frame reaching the chain because a package was imported is a frame nothing in the application's source mentions
    application_middleware_excepted_2026_08_17:
      what: RegisterMiddleware writes into a process list Middlewares reads, per requirement:fasthttp-middleware-registration
      why: the call is now pw.RegisterMiddleware with one word changed, so the two build-tagged mains differ only in the middleware body, which decision:backend-specific-middleware already requires them to
      why_it_is_not_the_thing_refused: the frame is named by the application's own main rather than gained from an import
      cost_accepted: a list cannot tell a main from a third-party init, so a package could register a frame the application never named; the same cost is already paid on the net/http side
      read_by_middlewares_rather_than_run: the chain a test assembles is then the chain Run serves, where a list only the entry point consulted would let the two differ with nothing to say so
      refusals: nil middleware, duplicate name, and the two fixed frames, each a panic with the pw wording
  websocket:
    was_recorded_here: that it waited on a dependency decision because the fork carried no websocket package
    corrected_2026_08_11: the fork's sibling does, and system:tinybind-websocket publishes fasthttpbind.WebSocket over it, so nothing waits on a dependency
    now: implemented 2026-08-11 as WebSocket, WebSocketWith, the Socket and SocketOptions aliases and the socket defaults, under the pw spelling; the origin check is the shared one, per decision:websocket-origin-check-owner
    verified: a real handshake and a typed round trip over a real listener, and a cross-origin upgrade refused with the same document the other half writes
dependency_cost:
  added: the fasthttp fork brings a brotli encoder and a byte buffer pool into the module graph
  linking: unaffected for a project that imports neither package
verification: a test serves each entry through a real fasthttp server over an in-memory listener, rather than calling handlers with a synthesized request value, so what is asserted is what reaches the wire
```
