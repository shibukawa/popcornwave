title: Client Update API
---
The browser surface requirement:unified-update-runtime installs, so application JavaScript can update the current route, navigate, redraw one region with explicit parameters, and apply what a mutating fetch returned.

```yaml
source: decision:update-runtime-convergence
namespace: one namespaced object under this framework's own name, read from the runtime configuration rather than compiled in; no bare global functions, per the injection rule of requirement:framework-script-assets
instantiation: update.js exports a factory and installs nothing on its own, so the bootstrap of requirement:unified-update-runtime constructs one instance and both halves of the asset share it
implemented_here: since 2026-08-04 every function behind this surface is this framework's, written against the wire contract system:tinybind publishes rather than inherited from its client
feature_detection: an author tests for the namespace rather than assuming it, since a page may load with the runtime disabled
surface:
  update: re-render the current route with different search parameters, replacing the URL rather than stacking a history entry
  navigate: move to another same-origin route, pushing a history entry
  redraw: re-render one registered component instance by its author-written id, with every declared parameter supplied
  apply: install the regions a mutating fetch returned, per requirement:action-response-update
  updateHeaders: the headers an application fetch must carry to ask for an action response
  subscribe: lifecycle outcomes for a progress indicator, an analytics call, or a widget that must reinitialize
  attribute names: the id, kind, preserve, and ignore attributes, so an author writing a marker from script uses the same spelling its templates do rather than guessing from a prefix it did not choose
  no_protocol_version: the contract defines none; the build identity is what two parties compare, and it is strictly stronger because it changes when a template, a Go function a template calls, or the client itself changes
  no_endpoint_prefix: a redraw is answered at the page URL, so there is no mount for a caller to read
redraw:
  arguments: the element id and every declared parameter, since nothing is reconstructed on the server
  local_rejection: an id no element carries is refused without a network request
  supersession: an older in-flight redraw for the same id is aborted
  result: applied, superseded, or fell back, resolved after the swap
  trust: the endpoint is public input under requirement:reloadable-component-endpoint, so this API is not an authorization boundary
  target: the page's own URL by default, or one the caller names; same-origin only, and never a URL derived from page content or a message
interception:
  links_and_get_forms: same-origin navigation is intercepted by default; a data attribute on an element or an ancestor returns it to the browser
  form_fields: become the query, so a search form refines the page it is on
  left_to_the_browser: non-GET submission, modified clicks, target, download, and cross-origin URLs, which is what keeps post-redirect-get working unchanged
  contract: requirement:query-navigation-interception, which is where the submitter's overrides, a fragment-only target, and the harness coverage this surface lacks are settled
events:
  kinds: start, applied, superseded, fell back, and redrawn
  payload: outcomes, never component arguments or validators
  safety: a failing subscriber cannot break the update it is watching
history_and_focus:
  url: pushed after the response commits, so a failed delta leaves history untouched
  scroll: recorded on the entry being left, restored on back and forward, with the browser's own restoration taken over so it cannot race the delta
  focus: the focused control is refocused with its selection, or focus moves to the main landmark
  detail: requirement:update-navigation-continuity, which also owns the composition deferral, the announcement, and the busy marker
security:
  origin: same-origin only
  csrf: an application fetch that mutates carries the policy:csrf-protection token; a redraw and a navigation are GETs and do not
  no_state_in_urls: manifest state and tokens never reach a URL, per policy:cookie-value-protection reasoning about what is loggable
errors:
  invalid_url: rejected without a request
  unknown_kind: the component changed since the page loaded, so a complete page load follows
  runtime_absent: no surface exists, which is why an author feature-detects
authoring_attributes:
  what: the preserve marker on a region the runtime must not replace, the ignore marker returning a link or form to the browser, and the busy marker the document root carries for the life of a navigation or a redraw
  busy_is_read_not_written: an author styles it and never sets it, which is what makes a progress affordance CSS rather than a subscriber every application writes again
  naming: derived from this framework's data attribute prefix, so an application template writes no dependency name
rules:
  - callers drive this API and never rewrite the runtime attributes a boundary carries
  - link interception and the explicit calls share one path, so behavior cannot diverge between them
  - the namespace is pw-owned and configured, not aliased over an inherited global
open_questions:
  - whether generated typed wrappers are worth emitting per reloadable component
  - whether prefetch joins this surface
```
