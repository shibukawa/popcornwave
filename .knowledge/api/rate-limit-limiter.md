title: Rate Limit Limiter Surface
---
The shipped shape of requirement:rate-limit-enforcement: one transport-free decision package, a frame pair per transport, and a counter-store seam that follows api:session-registry.

```yaml
verified: 2026-08-14, by reading the tree
packages:
  pwratelimit: the decision half; Config and validation, the Counter contract, the store registry, the Limiter with Exempt, Identity, and Admit, and the built-in memory counter
  middlewares: the net/http frames RateLimit and RateLimitProcess, which read the path and address and write the refusal
  pwfast: the same frame pair for the fasthttp build, per requirement:second-build-feature-parity; both drive one pwratelimit.Limiter so one configuration enforces one policy on either transport
  pw: aliases only, so an application names pw.RegisterRateLimitStore and pw.RateLimitCounter without importing the leaf
  ratelimitstore/redis: the shared-counter backend behind a blank import, mirroring sessionstore/redis
registration:
  mechanism: two entries through api:framework-extension; ratelimit.process in the outer stack where an unkeyed refusal costs least, and ratelimit below the authentication slot where the subject exists
  store_memoized: both frames resolve one opened counter per startup, so the ceiling and the identity bucket count in one place
  fasthttp: pwfast opens the store during run setup and installs the same two frames
counter_contract:
  interface: Increment(ctx, key, window) returning the new total, which is the whole storage interface
  fixed_window: a backend sets the expiry when it creates the key and never extends it
  registry: pwratelimit.RegisterStore from a plugin init, duplicate or empty name panics; OpenStore names the missing blank import when a configuration selects an unlinked backend
  memory: built in and default, correct on one replica, N times the limit on N of them
  redis: import _ ratelimitstore/redis; registration dials nothing, the client opens when ratelimit.backend selects it, and an unreachable server refuses startup rather than shipping a limiter that fails open permanently
surface:
  - pw.RegisterRateLimitStore(name, factory) and pwfast via pwratelimit.RegisterStore, for a deployment adding a backend
  - pw.RateLimitStores() lists linked backends, which is what the unknown-backend error reports
  - pwratelimit.NewLimiter(config, counter, exempt) returns nil for a disabled configuration, which a caller turns into a pass-through frame
  - Limiter.Exempt(path) answers the fixed carve-out; an empty canonical path is counted, so an unreadable path is not a way out
  - Limiter.Identity(ctx, address) resolves subject-or-address and the count that governs it
  - Limiter.Admit(ctx, key, limit, now) counts one arrival; a store error admits and reports, per the failure_mode of requirement:rate-limit-enforcement
behavior_notes:
  exemptions: computed from ServerConfig, the operational probes, the OpenAPI and API doc mounts, and the public asset mount, and not a deployment setting
  refusal: through the framework error path, so a browser gets the application's 429 page and an API client a problem document with the requirement:rate-limit-problem-responses metadata
  degraded: an admission without a working store logs at error level, since silently not limiting is the state worth knowing about
configuration: data:rate-limit-runtime-config, bound at the top-level ratelimit section on both builds
documented: 2026-08-14, guides/backend/rate-limiting in both locales and a ratelimit section in reference/configuration; the guide covers the two buckets, the process ceiling, the redis blank import, the fixed exemptions, and fail-open
```
