title: Passkey Credential Store
---
A passkey login resolves a credential before it knows an account, so plugin/auth reads and writes data:passkey-credential through a store seam that AccountResolver cannot serve.

```yaml
package: github.com/shibukawa/popcornweb/plugin/auth
problem:
  - flow:passkey-login receives a credential ID and must find the owning account from it
  - AccountResolver answers the opposite question, from a verified identity to an account
  - the accepted sign counter and backup state must persist atomically with the assertion result
surface:
  - auth.SetCredentialStore(store) installs the application implementation
  - Find(ctx, credentialID) returns data:passkey-credential or ErrUnknownCredential
  - ListByAccount(ctx, accountID) supplies excludeCredentials and allowCredentials
  - Save(ctx, credential, activate) persists a new credential and runs the activation callback in the same transaction
  - UpdateOnAssertion(ctx, credentialID, signCount, backupState, lastUsedAt) persists accepted ceremony output
  - Delete(ctx, accountID, credentialID) removes one credential under policy:account-recovery rules
  - auth.SetBootstrapStore(store) issues, verifies, and consumes data:account-bootstrap-credential
default:
  when: no store is installed
  backing: popcornweb_passkey_credential and popcornweb_auth_bootstrap under rule:framework-owned-tables
  reason: atomically persisting a sign counter is protocol correctness rather than application domain, and an application that gets it wrong shows no symptom until a cloned authenticator is used
  precedent: AccountResolver also carries a framework default, so an application enables a mode before writing storage code
  override: installing a store means the framework creates and verifies no table for that capability
  storage: relational by default, or the DynamoDB implementation of requirement:dynamodb-auth-stores when decision:auth-backend-selection names it
implemented:
  interfaces: CredentialStore and BootstrapStore, with SetCredentialStore and SetBootstrapStore
  default: both framework stores over the two tables, selected when nothing is installed
  transaction: Save opens one and passes it to the callback through the context, so the default bootstrap store joins that unit instead of opening its own
  attempts: RecordAttempt decrements in a single statement, so two parallel guesses cannot both spend the last attempt
  enumeration: an exhausted budget, a consumed credential, and an unknown login ID all return ErrUnknownBootstrap
  key_storage: the COSE blob and the curve points are both stored, because requirement:contrib-passkey verifies with the points and cross-checks them against the blob, so a corrupted row fails closed
  callers: api:passkey-endpoints login and enrollment
  pending: the bootstrap redemption path of passkey_only
atomicity:
  requirement: flow:passkey-only-registration must persist the credential, activate the provisional data:user-account, and consume the bootstrap credential as one unit
  mechanism: Save receives an activation callback and runs it inside its own transaction
  limit: the framework cannot span two databases, so an application whose accounts live elsewhere must install a store and own the whole unit
  failure: a partially applied ceremony is a defect, not a recoverable state
  relational_only: the transaction is the relational default's mechanism; decision:dynamodb-auth-compensating-registration replaces it with an ordered sequence and a bounded set of named partial states, and the guide states the difference where the backend is selected
counter_monotonicity:
  rule: UpdateOnAssertion moves the stored sign counter forward or fails, in one conditional statement rather than a read and a write
  tolerated: an incoming count of zero, which means the authenticator keeps no counter
  reason: the counter exists to expose a cloned authenticator, and a value that can be overwritten with a lower one detects nothing
  mechanism: the comparison rides in the WHERE clause of the relational UPDATE and in the DynamoDB condition expression, so both backends refuse the same thing and neither reads before it writes
  reports: ErrUnknownCredential when nothing was updated, which covers a missing credential and a counter that did not advance; both fail the ceremony closed
  stated_on_the_interface: the contract carries the rule, so a store an application installs is held to it rather than to whichever backend it was tested against
rules:
  - the framework never writes a credential outside a store call
  - a store error fails the ceremony closed and is never downgraded to a warning
  - store errors are logged without credential ID, user handle, or challenge, per policy:passkey-security
  - Find is answered in constant work regardless of whether the credential exists, so timing does not enumerate accounts
  - a disabled, deleted, or suspended owner makes Find succeed and the ceremony fail, so the two decisions stay separable and auditable
```
