title: Typed WebSocket API

pw.WebSocket upgrades a request and runs the caller's protocol loop against a typed socket, whose Read decodes the declared inbound struct and whose Write encodes the outbound one through generated codecs.

```yaml
status: implemented 2026-08-11, per requirement:typed-websocket
engine: system:tinybind-websocket
surface:
  - "WebSocket[In, Out](w, r, func(*Socket[In, Out]) error) error"
  - "WebSocketWith[In, Out](w, r, SocketOptions, func(*Socket[In, Out]) error) error"
  - "Socket.Read() (In, error), Socket.Write(Out) error, Socket.Close() error, Socket.Subprotocol() string"
  - SetSocketDefaults(SocketOptions) and SocketDefaults(), shared with the other runtime
second_build:
  names: identical, per api:pwfast-package, so a rewritten call moves its qualifier and nothing else
  parameter: the request value first and named r, matching every other pwfast entry
  one_type: pw.Socket and pwfast.Socket alias one declaration, so the callback parameter is one type across the pair
shape_reasons_inherited_rather_than_taken_here:
  callback: the fasthttp upgrader takes one and can express nothing else, which is the same forcing constraint api:typed-stream records
  returns_the_handshake_error_only: the handshake is pre-commit on both transports, so it can travel back; everything after the 101 cannot
  runtime_closes: the callback returning is the close, so a peer is never left without a close frame
  differs_from_the_stream: WriteStream returns nothing, because its only pre-commit failure was one the second transport could not express; here one is
message_typing:
  two_arguments: an inbound type and an outbound type, because real protocols are asymmetric
  variants: a discriminator field on the direction's own struct, read by the application, matching how api:typed-stream already spells event kinds
  library_names_nothing: the discriminator's spelling stays the application's
  admitted_cost: a variant's required fields are not required at compile time, which is the cost the stream has carried since it shipped
generation:
  patterns: SocketReceiveCall and SocketSendCall against pw.WebSocket and pw.WebSocketWith, registered in internal/pwgen/options.go
  inference: both types are recovered from the closure parameter, so the call site spells neither
  failure_without_it: a runtime missing-codec error on a connection that already returned 101, which is a socket that opens and then dies
  transform: the patterns are also what stop a handler calling this from being refused as an untraceable call, per requirement:pw-call-registration
what_the_caller_writes: the loop, the protocol, and any registry of open sockets
what_the_runtime_holds: the read limit, the idle and write deadlines, the ping cadence, the pong accounting, the close handshake, and write serialization
errors:
  handshake: returned, with the refusal already written as api:problem-response; the handler logs or counts it rather than answering
  callback: post-commit, reaching the installed sink, since no status is left to carry it
  decode: returned from Read without closing the socket, because a message the application cannot read is the application's to answer
lifetime_rule:
  what: the callback must not read w or r
  why: on the second build it runs after the handler returned, so the request value belongs to whichever request occupies that slot next
  enforcement: rule:transport-handle-checks PW0604, which refuses a captured transport value whatever else the function does
  practice: the identity, the query values and anything else are captured before the entry is called
what_can_be_captured:
  found_2026_08_11: by writing the module's own example idiom into internal/transportfixture and watching the analysis refuse it
  refused: "r.RemoteAddr, reported as reads r.RemoteAddr, which no rewrite covers; the transform's selector table carries Context and nothing else"
  consequence: the peer address has no portable spelling, so a socket handler that wants one is a handler the second build refuses
  works: a registered pw accessor such as QueryValue or PathValue, and anything reached through r.Context(), which the table does rewrite
  scope_of_the_finding: verified for RemoteAddr alone; the other request fields were not probed
  worth_fixing_separately: an accessor for the client address would also give the socket the resolved caller rather than the peer, which is what requirement:proxied-request-identity resolves for every other consumer
choosing_between_this_and_a_stream:
  stream: anything that keeps HTTP framing — server-sent events, newline-delimited records, progressive output, long polling
  socket: a protocol where the client also talks after the request, which is the one thing a stream cannot do
  default: the stream, because it survives proxies, needs no origin check, and carries the api:problem-response path all the way through
```
