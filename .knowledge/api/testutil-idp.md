title: Test Identity Provider
---
testutil starts an in-process requirement:contrib-devidp beside an api:test-run server and pre-selects the logged-in user, so flow:oidc-account-login runs in a test without a browser.

```yaml
package: github.com/shibukawa/popcornweb/testutil
surface:
  - WithIdentityProvider(options ...IdPOption) RunOption
  - WithLoginUser(subject string) IdPOption
  - WithIdPConfig(path string), WithIdPRoster(source string), and WithIdPUsers(users ...devidp.User) supply the roster
  - WithIdPScopes(scopes ...string) IdPOption
  - WithIdPClient(redirectURIs ...string) IdPOption registers an exact-match client instead of the default loopback client
  - WithIdPBinding(func(*Config, IdPInfo)) IdPOption writes the issuer and generated credentials into the copied configuration
  - (*Server).IdP() returns the running provider and (*Server).IdPInfo() returns the issuer and credentials
  - (*Server).LoginAs(t, subject) changes the pre-selected user mid-test
roster_source: exactly one of WithIdPConfig, WithIdPRoster, or WithIdPUsers
run_option_order:
  - reserve a loopback port and start the provider before the application server
  - write the resolved issuer and client credentials into the copied configuration
  - continue with the api:test-run and api:test-seed order
login_user:
  default: none; without it the authorization endpoint renders ui:devidp-login, which a test must drive itself
  effect: the authorization endpoint skips ui:devidp-login and redirects immediately with a code
  scope: process-wide for the provider instance, so parallel subtests share it unless each starts its own server
configuration_injection:
  client: the provider registers an ephemeral client for this run, so WithIdPClient is only needed for a second manually driven client
  target: whatever configuration type WithIdPBinding writes, typically data:authentication-runtime-config oidc fields
  mechanism: direct assignment into the copied configuration, because api:test-run already isolates it and no child process exists
  ordering: the binding runs after customize, so it overwrites a placeholder the test left behind
  reason: the framework registers no auth binding yet, so the application names the type its own configuration uses
  roster: WithIdPConfig reads data:devidp-config from disk, WithIdPRoster parses it from a string, and WithIdPUsers supplies it in memory
lifecycle:
  - the provider registers testing cleanup and closes before the application server
  - Provider.Close destroys keys and pending authorizations
failure_reporting:
  interface: decision:testutil-testing-interface
  startup: TestingT Fatalf on roster, client, or port failures
  guardrails: policy:devidp-safety refusals are reported as test failures, never downgraded to warnings
rules:
  - the provider is not started unless WithIdentityProvider is supplied
  - tests assert on verified claims, not on provider internals
  - no test may reuse an issuer or signing key across api:test-run servers
```
