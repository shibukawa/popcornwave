postgres.WithConn hands the pgx connection behind a requirement:pgx-native-execution connection to a callback, so pgx capabilities stay reachable without a pgx type entering the pw surface.

```yaml
status: implemented 2026-08-09
requirement: requirement:native-pgx-escape-hatch
surface:
  - WithConn(context.Context, func(*pgx.Conn) error) error
package: the postgres engine package, which an application already blank-imports
  to select the scheme; pw itself gains nothing
resolution: >
  pwruntime.SQLExecutor, so the effective group and any open transaction are
  resolved by the same code one generated statement passes through, then the
  query-diagnostics wrapper is peeled by a structural Unwrap assertion and the
  result is matched against this package's own native handle types
shape_source: the WithConn of system:tinygodriver, which solved the same problem
  for a *sql.DB and whose signature this keeps so the two read alike
type_identity:
  named_through: the tinygodriver database/pgx aliases, which are the upstream
    pgx types on host Go and the vendored fork under TinyGo
  consequence: caller code written against those names compiles on both
    compilers; code naming jackc pgx directly is host Go only, and no accessor
    can fix that
connection:
  group: the effective group of the context, per api:database-selection
  no_scope_open: lease a connection from the pool and release it after the
    callback
  scope_open: the connection the scope's transaction is executing on, per
    decision:escape-hatch-transaction-scope
  wrong_engine: a named error identifying the dialect, never a panic and never
    a nil connection
lifetime:
  rule: nothing derived from the connection outlives the callback, including
    BatchResults, Rows, and a LargeObjects handle
  why: >
    the pooled connection returns to the pool when the callback ends, and on a
    leased conn the framework has no way to know a caller still holds a cursor
    on it. A caller keeping rows copies them out inside the callback
  streaming_is_fine: iterating Rows with Next inside the callback is normal;
    what is forbidden is letting the value escape
what_it_reaches:
  - SendBatch, whose per-engine standing is rule:batch-engine-capability
  - CopyFrom, the bulk-ingest path deliberately excluded from any batch
  - LISTEN and NOTIFY, through Exec and WaitForNotification
  - errors.As against the pgx error type for SQLSTATE
observability:
  gap: >
    work inside the callback does not pass through
    api:instrumented-sql-executor, so it produces no data:query-record of its
    own and flow:query-diagnostics goes dark for the duration
  closed_by_the_caller: >
    the framework's general observability surface already covers it, and needs
    no addition. A caller opens a span around the call and logs inside it;
    because pw.Logger reads the span active on the context, those records
    correlate with that span without being told to
  recipe:
    span: pw.StartSpanKind with pw.SpanKindClient, since the work leaves the
      process, named for the operation rather than the statement
    log: pw.Logger inside that span, carrying the counts the caller cares about
      as pw.Int and pw.Duration attributes
    scope: one span for the batch or copy as a whole, not one per queued
      statement, because per-statement timing is what the hatch gave up
    documented_in: the guide owned by requirement:native-pgx-escape-hatch
  why_not_instrumented_here: >
    observing from inside would mean wrapping every pgx verb the callback might
    reach, which is the surface widening this accessor exists to avoid, and the
    wrapper would still see only the verbs it anticipated
  the_seam_that_would:
    what: pgx traces its own work through tracer interfaces installed on the
      connection config, covering batches with no wrapping at all
    blocked_by: system:tinygodriver aliases the query tracer but not the batch
      one, so a framework-wide tracer needs that alias upstream first
    standing: a later path, deliberately not part of this requirement
rules:
  - the callback runs on one connection, so a caller cannot fan out across the
    pool from inside it
  - the accessor opens, commits, and rolls back nothing, per
    decision:explicit-transaction-boundary
  - a panic in the callback releases the connection before it propagates
  - nothing here appears in pw; a project that never imports the engine package
    directly never sees a pgx type
```
