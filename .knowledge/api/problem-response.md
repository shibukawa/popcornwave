title: Problem Response API

Popcorn Wave uses one safe error value for API problems and negotiated HTML error pages.

```yaml
surface:
  - Problem error type re-exported from TinyBind
  - FieldError type and Field(field, location, message) FieldError
  - BadRequest(...) Problem
  - Unauthorized(...) Problem
  - Forbidden(...) Problem
  - NotFound(...) Problem
  - Conflict(...) Problem
  - PayloadTooLarge(...) Problem
  - InternalServerError(...) Problem
  - Validation(fields ...FieldError) Problem
  - WriteProblem(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, error)
api:
  format: RFC problem details
  field_failures: errors array carrying field, location, and message
negotiation:
  rule: WriteProblem picks its representation from the request Accept header, not from the caller
  html: a client that prefers text/html gets the api:error-renderer template of the status
  api: everything else gets RFC problem details, which is also what an absent or unreadable Accept takes
  reason: one handler answers a browser form post and an API client on the same route, and neither should have to be branched on by hand; the tutorial's chapter on forms only reached for that branch because this was missing
  vary: responses carry Vary Accept, since the same URL now answers two ways
  fallbacks: no registered error page, no fragment for the status, or a render that failed all take the API branch, so an error page can never be the reason a failure goes unanswered
  sanitization: the 5xx rule applies at each writer rather than at the caller, because a boundary that failed with no recover clause reaches the HTML writer without passing through WriteProblem
html:
  templates:
    400: templates/400.pw.html
    401: templates/401.pw.html
    403: templates/403.pw.html
    404: templates/404.pw.html
    409: templates/409.pw.html
    413: templates/413.pw.html
    500: templates/500.pw.html
detail_by_environment:
  axis: data:runtime-environment, not the status and not the client
  mechanism: the problem is trimmed before the page resolver sees it, so an application template cannot widen what its environment allows
  development: the page shows what the problem carries — title, status, code, detail, and the field failures with their locations — because the reader is the person who caused it and is about to fix it
  elsewhere: title, status, and the request id only, so a page served to the public says what went wrong and nothing about why
  unchanged_by_this: the api branch, which policy:validation-errors already bounds, and the 5xx rule that drops field failures and the private cause in every environment
  reason: the same template serves both, so the difference has to be in what it is given rather than in which template is chosen
rules:
  - expose only safe public details
  - drop field failures from 5xx responses
  - retain private causes and diagnostics in logs and traces
  - after response commitment, record failures without rewriting the response
```
