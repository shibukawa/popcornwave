title: Error Rendering Contract

Generated standard error templates implement the HTML branch of api:problem-response while API clients retain RFC problem details.

```yaml
model:
  status: HTTP status
  title: safe summary
  detail: optional safe public detail
  code: stable machine code
  request_id: optional diagnostic identifier
selection:
  by: the request Accept header, per api:problem-response negotiation
  html: generated 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 413, or 500 .pw.html renderer
  api: api:problem-response RFC problem details
template_parameters:
  rule: an error template takes the model above as parameters and renders it, so the page says which request failed and why
  registration: api:cli-init scaffolds the resolver that maps a status onto its template; without one the templates are generated and never reached
  fields: the field failures are a repeatable parameter, so a rejected form can name the field it rejected
  bounded_by: api:problem-response detail_by_environment, which decides how much of the model is populated before the template sees it
  unpopulated: a parameter the environment withholds arrives empty rather than absent, so one template renders in both without a conditional per field
fallback:
  - use a minimal safe built-in response when no HTML renderer is registered
  - do not recursively invoke an error renderer when it fails
  - log the renderer failure and return a safe internal response if headers remain uncommitted
async_escalation:
  trigger: decision:unhandled-boundary-escalation
  registration: pw.RegisterHTMLErrorPage, resolving a fragment from the mapped problem
  streaming: the document is written into an already committed 200 response, so the status cannot carry the failure
  buffered: nothing is committed, so the same page is answered with its real status through the wrapper chain
  independent_of: the root package ErrorRenderer, which writes a whole response rather than a fragment
rules:
  - generated renderer fragments register during package import
  - renderers receive only sanitized policy:validation-errors output
  - never expose stack traces, SQL, DSNs, tokens, or private error causes
```
