title: Passkey Endpoints
---
The runtime mounts passkey login, enrollment, and bootstrap endpoints for the modes that select them, so an application registers no ceremony route and writes no WebAuthn code.

```yaml
package: github.com/shibukawa/popcornwave/plugin/auth
relying_party: requirement:contrib-passkey, configured from the passkey fields of data:authentication-runtime-config
implemented:
  modes: every mode serves; oidc_only mounts nothing here, oidc_passkey mounts four endpoints, passkey_only mounts five
  transport: POST only, application/json required, same-origin checked, no-store on every response
  state: contrib/authstate/sqlite under its own namespace, keyed by a strict same-site cookie scoped to the base path
  counter_policy: a counter that does not advance refuses the login rather than only warning, because an authenticator that keeps no counter reports zero on both sides and never reaches that branch
  account: a passkey assertion resolves an account ID, so auth.SetAccountLookup supplies the display data an OIDC login gets from claims
  enrollment_ticket:
    form: an opaque key in a strict same-site cookie over an expiring authstate record, deliberately not a session
    reason: an account that proved only a temporary secret is not logged in, so pw.Authenticated stays false and no handler can mistake the ticket for authority
    rotation: begin reissues the ticket under a new key, because the store offers only a consuming read, which also kills whatever key the browser held
    single_use: finish spends it, so an abandoned enrollment cannot be resumed
  issuance: auth.IssueBootstrapCredential returns the raw secret once; who may call it and how the secret travels stay with the application
  activation: auth.SetAccountActivator runs inside the transaction that persists the first credential
  evidence: plugin/auth/passkeye2e and plugin/auth/passkeyonlye2e drive both stories over real HTTP with requirement:contrib-passkey-test
activation:
  oidc_only: no passkey endpoint is mounted
  oidc_passkey: login and enrollment mount beside the api:authentication-endpoints OIDC endpoints
  passkey_only: login, enrollment, and bootstrap mount, and no OIDC endpoint exists
base_path:
  field: auth.passkey.path, default /auth/passkey
  reason: five paths must stay mutually consistent and every one must remain reachable past policy:authenticated-path-protection, so one key is safer to configure than five
  suffixes:
    - POST {base}/login/begin
    - POST {base}/login/finish
    - POST {base}/register/begin
    - POST {base}/register/finish
    - POST {base}/bootstrap
transport:
  method: POST only, for the reason api:authentication-endpoints gives for logout
  body: JSON in the requirement:contrib-passkey wire shapes, so a browser posts what the WebAuthn API returned
  content_type: application/json is required, which a simple cross-origin form cannot send
  origin: same-origin checked until policy:csrf-protection lands, then the token replaces the check
  cache: no-store on every response
login:
  begin: start authentication in the configured discoverable mode, store ceremony state, return request options
  finish: verify the assertion, resolve data:passkey-credential through api:auth-credential-store, run flow:passkey-login, rotate the session
  anonymous: both are reachable without a session and are excluded from the guard by default
  enumeration: an unknown credential, an inactive account, and a bad signature produce one identical response
register:
  begin: require an authenticated session whose authenticated_at is within auth.recent_auth_max_age, then start registration
  finish: run flow:passkey-enrollment and persist through api:auth-credential-store
  exclude: the existing credential IDs of the account become excludeCredentials
  session: rotate when the deployment treats enrollment as an authentication-strength change
bootstrap:
  mode: passkey_only only; the endpoint is absent elsewhere
  request: login ID and one-time secret from data:account-bootstrap-credential
  effect: open the restricted enrollment session of flow:passkey-only-registration and never a normal session
  next: the client continues with register/begin and register/finish, which consume the credential on success
  limits: auth.bootstrap.max_attempts, auth.bootstrap.issue_ttl, and auth.bootstrap.enrollment_ttl
  security: policy:bootstrap-credential-security
ceremony_state:
  store: requirement:contrib-auth-state through api:auth-state-codec, the same store the OIDC transaction already uses
  correlation: an opaque key in a short-lived cookie scoped to the base path, matching the OIDC transaction cookie
  reason: the challenge never leaves the server, so a captured response cannot be replayed against another ceremony
session:
  method: data:request-authentication records method passkey
  record: the session stores the authenticating method and authenticated_at, which recent_auth_max_age reads
rules:
  - an endpoint absent from the selected mode returns 404, so the mode is not discoverable by probing
  - a rejected ceremony never reveals whether the account, the credential, or the signature failed
  - responses follow the policy:passkey-security privacy rules, so no challenge, credential ID, or user handle is logged
  - the framework mounts these paths; an application that needs a different shape writes its own handlers against requirement:contrib-passkey instead
```
