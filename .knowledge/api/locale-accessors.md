title: Locale Accessors
---
One opaque locale value is resolved once per request or parsed once from stored data, and every generated message takes it as an ordinary argument.

```yaml
surface:
  - pw.Locale
  - pw.LocaleContext(context.Context) pw.Locale
  - pw.ParseLocale(tag string) (pw.Locale, bool)
  - pw.LocaleChoices(context.Context) []pw.LocaleChoice
  - pw.SetLocale(http.ResponseWriter, pw.Locale)
  - pw.LocalePath(pw.Locale, path string) string
placement: pw, beside api:request-context-accessors, with the naming of policy:request-scoped-accessor-shape
locale_type:
  opaque: it carries a dense index the segment tables of decision:message-code-shape are addressed by
  public_in_pw: vision:popcorn-wave keeps handwritten code importing pw only, so the type cannot live in the generated package
  constants: the generated message package exposes one per declared locale
  boundary_note: this is the concept:public-package-boundaries seam of this feature, since the value is meaningless without the generated tables
  crosses_into_templates_typed: the message binding of data:locale-bindings declares pw.Locale as its provider result, so a generated message symbol takes this type rather than a tag string, and system:tinybind passes it through without learning it
template_bindings_are_fed_from_here:
  fact: each entry of data:locale-bindings is a provider taking the render context, and each provider is one of these accessors
  message_binding: LocaleContext
  langtag: the tag of LocaleContext
  lang: the tag under path mode and the empty string otherwise, which is the only provider whose value depends on the route's mode
  consequence: a template never calls an accessor, and the mode-dependence lives in one provider rather than in every template
resolution:
  once_per_request: at routing, per the mode of decision:locale-url-modes
  before_the_first_byte: required by policy:locale-vary-correctness, so a lazy resolve at the first message reference is not admissible
  parse: ParseLocale performs RFC 4647 lookup against the declared set, reporting absence rather than substituting the default
generated_messages_take_it_explicitly:
  signature: a generated message is func(loc pw.Locale, args...) string
  effect: the same function serves a handler, a batch job, a mail renderer, and a push notification with no request in scope
  template_sugar: the reference of decision:upstream-message-surface item B supplies the locale from context, so a template author never writes it
  consequence: no separate library mode exists, because the generated surface already is one
switching:
  SetLocale: validates against the declared set and writes the plain mode cookie of policy:cookie-value-protection through api:cookie-jar
  markup: not here; requirement:locale-switching-surface leaves the control to the application
LocalePath:
  for: Go-side URL construction, being redirects, Location headers, mail bodies, and deep links
  not_for: templates, where decision:explicit-locale-in-links writes the binding inline instead
  empty_prefix: applies the same collapse rule, so a caller need not branch on the mode
absent_is_not_a_default:
  ParseLocale: reports absence for an unmatched tag, per policy:absent-rather-than-stubbed
  LocaleContext: always answers, because the mode resolved a locale for every request; a route outside every declared mode entry answers the default
testing:
  determinism: no clock, network, or shared state
  path_mode: a request path carrying a prefix
  cookie_mode: a cookie, which outranks a contradicting header and is the case worth asserting
  batch: ParseLocale alone, with no request
```
