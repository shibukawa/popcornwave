pw.Redirect sends a browser to another location, choosing between a Location response and the api:html-update-options navigate directive so an action handler stops writing that branch by hand.

```yaml
returned_form:
  what: SeeOther, TemporaryRedirect, MovedPermanently, and PermanentRedirect return an error carrying a location and a status
  why: requirement:explicit-page-loading moved a page's load into its template, and a loader returns (T, error) with no writer to write to; the render hands its error to the response path unwrapped
  recognized_by: WriteProblem on both transports, before the problem mapping, since that is the one path a render's error takes
  delegates_to: the writing Redirect, so the navigability check and the update-request branch cover the returned form without a second implementation
  naming: by status, like the problem constructors beside them, since both are values a function returns rather than writes; no name says Error, because the value signals an outcome rather than a failure
  four_codes:
    axes: permanent or not, and whether the method survives
    one_constructor_each: so a status no browser follows cannot be spelled, and nothing has to validate one
    which_a_page_wants: SeeOther, because the target is fetched with GET whatever the request was
    why_the_method_axis_is_quiet_here: a loader answers a render, the render answers a GET, and 303 and 307 are indistinguishable on one
status: implemented 2026-08-10
as_built:
  surface: pw.Redirect and pw.RedirectSeeOther, plus pw.QueryValue and pw.FormValue for the one-value reads a handler would otherwise take from the request itself
  found_it_the_hard_way: the transport report over the examples refused todo/popcornweb three times for http.Redirect and htmx_fragment four times for direct form and query reads, which is the same finding this concept opened with and the first evidence that it was real rather than argued
  body: the stdlib body is kept for the branch that reaches it, since a browser that follows the redirect never sees it and paying a template render on every redirect to discard it is the trade this concept already rejected
package: github.com/shibukawa/popcornweb/pw
replaces: http.Redirect in application code, per decision:transport-handle-containment
surface:
  - pw.Redirect(w, r, url string, status int)
  - pw.RedirectSeeOther(w, r, url string), the post-action form that fixes 303
what_the_stdlib_already_does:
  body: http.Redirect writes a body only for GET, and only when the caller set no Content-Type; it is '<a href="...">See Other</a>.' and nothing more
  no_body: HEAD gets the header only because HTTP forbids the body, and POST gets none either, so the redirect-after-post case sends headers alone
  reason: RFC 7231 notes the short body exists for user agents that do not understand the status, which is why it is a bare link rather than a message
  absolute: it resolves a relative target against the request path before sending it
what_pw_adds:
  update_branch:
    condition: pw.WantsUpdate(r)
    action: emit the navigate directive of api:html-update-options rather than a Location response
    reason: an update request is a fetch, so a 303 is followed by the fetch and its target applied as a region set for the wrong page; requirement:action-response-update calls WantsUpdate the one branch point, and this is the branch an action handler writes today
  navigable_target: the target is refused unless safeurl allows it, on both branches, so a request-derived return path cannot become script execution the way api:html-update-options already refuses it
  body:
    content: a short escaped document naming the destination as a link, with a line saying the page is moving
    methods: GET and POST; never HEAD, and never when the caller already set Content-Type
    not_a_template: it is not rendered through api:html-response or api:error-renderer, because the body is seen only when the browser does not follow the redirect, and a themed render would be paid on every redirect to be discarded on almost all of them
    escaping: the destination is escaped as text and as an attribute, per policy:template-escaping
  caching: a target derived from request state carries Cache-Control no-store, which is what pw scriptless redirect handling already does for its own
status_codes:
  after_action: 303, so a reload does not repost, which is the case examples and scaffolds use
  explicit: any other code is the caller's, and the surface does not guess one
rules:
  - the surface writes the response and returns nothing; a handler that must inspect the outcome had a different problem
  - a redirect after a session change orders itself after the session write, because the response is committed here
  - the update branch and the Location branch send the same destination, so one handler cannot mean two places
```
