title: Page Render Runtime
---
One pw-owned package supplies every symbol generated page code calls, so decision:page-render-binding needs no generation template of its own and applications never name it.

```yaml
package: github.com/shibukawa/popcornweb/pwpage
audience: generated page tree code, like the generated-runtime boundary of concept:public-package-boundaries
backing_pw_api:
  WriteHTMLPage: renders a page inside its own wrapper chain and the registered document, with the document outermost; it is the one thing this package could not compose itself, because the document is deliberately not reachable from outside pw
  HTMLOption: the render option type, added so a caller can extend the set api:html-response derives rather than replace it
  threading: the option slice reaches both the buffered and the streaming branch, and caller options come last so a later one wins
surface:
  Router: the one-method router interface the generated Register takes, satisfied by both mux types of flow:handler-registration
  Wrapper: the layout wrapper type, an alias of the pw HTML wrapper
  Option: the render option type, an alias of the runtime option
  Render: the render entry taking the writer, the request, the layout chain, the leaf fragment, and options, returning error
not_here:
  errors: WriteProblem, BadRequest, and Problem come straight from pw, because system:tinybind v0.2.6 made the failure selector a symbol and pw already spells the other two the way the decoder writes them
  effect: this package holds no wrapper that exists only to rename something
placement:
  package: its own package rather than pwruntime, because the render entry needs the pw response path and pw imports pwruntime, so pwruntime cannot import pw back
  rejected_alternative: a function variable in pwruntime that pw sets during initialization, which turns a compile-time dependency into a runtime one and adds a nil state to the render path
  not_pw_itself: the Option name is already the api:application-lifecycle option in pw, and generated code needs Option to mean a render option; that name collision is the entire reason this package exists
render_entry:
  chain: takes the chain as given, nil for a page with no ancestor layout, so one entry covers both shapes
  policy: derives its per-request options from data:html-render-config through api:html-response, then appends the ones the caller passed, so a call site cannot silently replace framework policy
  error_result: returns an error because the generated caller writes one through WriteError, even though the pw response path already answers a failure itself; a nil return is the normal case
rules:
  - handwritten application code has no reason to import this package
  - the surface is whatever the generation templates name, so it grows only when system:tinybind adds a called symbol
  - every entry delegates to pw rather than reimplementing a response decision
```
