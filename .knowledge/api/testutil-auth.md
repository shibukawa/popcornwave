title: Test Authentication Seams
---
authtest installs an authenticated request context without a server, and testutil mints a real session without a ceremony, so an application tests behavior behind the guard at the cost the test deserves.

```yaml
packages:
  - github.com/shibukawa/popcornweb/plugin/auth/authtest
ladder: decision:test-authentication-seams
authtest:
  implemented: plugin/auth/authtest, with the api:cli-build guard registered
  surface:
    - authtest.NewContext(ctx, authtest.Identity{...}) returns a context carrying an authenticated data:request-authentication
    - authtest.NewRequest(method, target, body, authtest.Identity{...}) returns an httptest.NewRequest already carrying it
    - authtest.Anonymous(ctx) and authtest.NewAnonymousRequest return the explicit unauthenticated state, so a test proves the deny path
    - auth.MethodOIDC and auth.MethodPasskey name the method, so a test compares against a constant rather than a literal
  identity:
    fields: account ID, display name, method, authenticated_at, and optional application principal and scope
    default: method oidc and authenticated_at now, so a recent_auth_max_age check passes unless the test sets otherwise
    subject: the account ID becomes the authentication subject, which is what plugin/auth records, so a test and a real login agree
  readers: pw.RequestAuthentication, pw.Authenticated, and auth.User read the value exactly as they do in production
  mechanism: pwruntime.WithSession and pwruntime.WithAuthentication, which are already exported and which concept:public-package-boundaries already keeps out of handwritten application code
  reach:
    bare_handler: the test calls the handler and nothing else runs
    full_stack: the test calls ServeHTTP against the real middleware chain, and the value survives under the decision:test-authentication-seams middleware contract
    guard: policy:authenticated-path-protection therefore admits the request, so a test can prove both the allow and the deny path without a server
  rules:
    - the package builds a value and never contacts a store, a session, or a database
    - it installs no cookie, so nothing it produces can travel over a real connection
server_rung:
  implemented: plugin/auth/authtest, beside the handler rung
  placement: plugin/auth/authtest rather than testutil, because a session payload is a plugin/auth type and testutil is framework generic; testutil needed no change at all
  surface:
    - authtest.NewClient(serverURL, Identity) returns an http.Client whose jar holds a real session
    - authtest.Authenticate(client, serverURL, Identity) installs one into a jar the test already built
    - authtest.SessionCookies(Identity) returns the cookies for a test that manages its own jar
  mechanism: auth.EstablishSession creates the session through api:session-manager exactly as a completed login does, so rotation, lifetime, and cookie attributes are the production ones
  reach: the request travels a real connection and passes every framework middleware including policy:authenticated-path-protection
  evidence: plugin/auth/passkeye2e proves the guard denies anonymous, admits the seam client, and denies it again after logout
establish_session:
  surface: auth.EstablishSession(w, r, data, method)
  audience: an application whose own flow authenticated a user, not only tests
  safety: it authenticates nobody and nothing a remote client sends can reach it, which is the class SetAccountResolver is already in; it is not middleware reading attacker-controlled input
  naming: AuthenticatedClient rather than LoginAs, because api:testutil-idp already uses LoginAs for pre-selecting the provider user, and the two would read as the same act
  modes: usable in every auth.mode, including oidc_only, where it removes the need to start requirement:contrib-devidp for a test that is not about login
ceremony_rung: api:testutil-passkey and api:testutil-idp remain the only seams that exercise a real ceremony
rules:
  - neither package writes a data:passkey-credential row or an external identity; a test that needs one uses the ceremony rung
  - a framework test of plugin/auth may not use these seams to assert that authentication succeeded
  - both seams fail the test through decision:testutil-testing-interface rather than returning an error a test can ignore
```
