title: HTML Update Options
---
One pw-owned value carries every setting the update surface needs, so an application configures partial updates the way it configures the rest of the runtime and never names system:tinybind.

```yaml
source: decision:update-runtime-convergence
backs: the upstream htmlupdate Options value, which pw constructs and never exposes
audience: api:application-lifecycle wiring and api:page-registry, per concept:public-package-boundaries
configuration:
  owner: data:html-render-config, as the update section of the existing html block
  keys:
    html.update.enabled: whether the mode negotiation, the endpoints, and the runtime tag are installed; default follows requirement:incremental-project-capabilities rather than being on for every project
    html.update.validator_key: the secret keying the frame and input validators
    html.update.max_manifest_bytes: the cap on the hint header, with the upstream default when unset
  framework_fixed:
    header_prefix: Pw, which from system:tinybind v0.3.1 reaches the browser as configuration rather than by rebuilding the runtime
    path_prefix: the reserved prefix of requirement:framework-script-assets, so nothing the framework owns can move outside one routing rule
    data_attribute_prefix: one value used by generation, by the boundary render option, and by the runtime, so one document holds one spelling
    prefix_is_the_module_default_not_the_brand:
      why: system:tinybind routetree compiles a page tree's templates without threading the prefix option, so branding it would give a page tree the default while a registered-router template took the brand, and one document would hold both spellings
      chosen: agreement over branding, since the runtime reads its prefix from configuration and gains nothing from the name
      revisit: when the option reaches both generation paths; requirement:tinybind-update-composition-seams carries the ask
    global_name: this framework's own namespace, per api:client-update-api
    runtime_serving: declared caller-owned, so the module serves no asset and emits no tag of its own
    reason_they_are_fixed: they are contracts of requirement:unified-update-runtime rather than deployment choices, and a project changing one would describe a framework it is not running
validator_key:
  required_when: any page that is not public, since an unkeyed digest of low-entropy content lets a guess be confirmed by comparing digests
  absent: startup rejects the configuration when updates are enabled, per the startup validation of requirement:shared-web-runtime, rather than serving unkeyed digests
  rotation: not a break; comparisons miss and the next response is a complete document
  secrecy: the key is secret configuration metadata, so policy:query-log-safety and rule:configuration-advisories treat it as data:session-runtime-config secrets are treated
build_identity:
  value: the vcs.revision stamp the binary carries, or the module's per-process value for a dirty or unstamped tree
  same_question_as: api:live-delivery-protocol, which also asks whether the page requesting was rendered by this build
  differs_when_unstamped:
    live: reports nothing, which disables the check rather than inventing a value that would differ per process and reload every client on every restart
    update: falls back to the per-process value, which costs a complete document after a restart and never a wrong delta
    why_the_split_is_right: a frozen live screen is worse than a re-transferred page, so the two failure modes are not the same trade
  effect: a page from another build is served a complete document, and a redraw from one is refused
headers:
  render: Pw-Render, carrying 'mode;v=N'
  manifest: Pw-Manifest, carrying the validators the browser already holds
  build: Pw-Build, carrying the build the page was rendered by
  modes: document when absent, plus navigation, action, redraw, and the live token of api:live-delivery-protocol
  oversized_manifest: dropped rather than rejected, so the response is a larger delta instead of an error
mount:
  what: the redraw endpoint of requirement:reloadable-component-endpoint; the runtime asset is this framework's, so the module registers none
  how: the module's own Mount, whose router interface api:serve-mux satisfies unchanged from system:tinybind v0.3.1
  where: under the reserved prefix, alongside the framework script route
  collision: an unknown path below the reserved prefix still answers 404 ahead of application routing, so the reserved-prefix handler must learn these routes rather than being bypassed
  registry: the reloadable component set, nil when a project publishes none
startup_validation:
  options: the module reports every unusable option at once, which folds into the startup validation of requirement:shared-web-runtime rather than failing on the first one
  registration: a duplicate or unidentified reloadable component returns an error, so a generated registry reports a diagnostic instead of aborting the process
  key: a missing validator key with updates enabled is refused here, before request acceptance
csrf:
  field_and_header: the hidden field name generation writes and the header the runtime sends, kept at the module defaults; the header is deliberately outside the Pw namespace because it is a name middleware already looks for
  verification: a module entry reads header first then body and compares in constant time, which policy:csrf-protection calls through rather than reimplementing
  token_supply: requirement:module-native-csrf, which passes it as a render option rather than through this value
vary:
  what: a composition reports the request properties its output varies on, readable before rendering
  use: an honest Vary header on a document or delta response, instead of the fixed set this framework guesses today
  source: declared by a registered element and folded across the call graph by system:tinybind v0.3.3
failure_hook:
  what: every refused redraw reaches this framework with its kind, status, message, cause, and the component and instance it named
  routed_to: api:error-renderer for the response and the request-scoped logger of api:logger for the record, so a redraw failure is no longer invisible
  observability: the kind is a stable token, so requirement:modern-observability can count refusals by cause and distinguish ordinary version skew from anything else
  version_skew_is_normal: an unknown component after a deploy is the expected fallback path, so it is recorded rather than alerted on
surface:
  Negotiate: what a request asked for, resolved before route execution
  WantsUpdate: whether the caller can apply an action response, which is the one branch point of requirement:action-response-update
  WriteUpdate and WriteUpdateStatus: the changed regions, with the handler's real status
  WriteNavigate: a directive replacing the region list when the action changed where the user belongs, selected on the caller's behalf by api:redirect-response
  ScriptTag: the element loading the merged runtime, emitted by pw rather than by the upstream helper
rules:
  - pw tests its own modes before delegating, per the ordering rule of decision:update-runtime-convergence
  - every negotiated response varies on the render header, and a delta response is never stored by a shared cache
  - an unrecognized mode, version, or build resolves to a complete document rather than an error, which is what lets each capability ship incomplete without ever being incorrect
  - handwritten application code configures this through data:html-render-config and never constructs the value
```
