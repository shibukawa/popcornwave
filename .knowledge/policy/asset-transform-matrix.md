title: Asset Transform Matrix
---
What a source file becomes, whether its authored bytes still ship, and what else the conversion drags with it, stated per file kind because the answers disagree.

```yaml
axes:
  source_ships: whether the authored bytes reach concept:derived-public-tree
  url_change: whether a template reference has to be rewritten, which decides whether a generation hook is involved at all
  extra_outputs: files the build writes that no reference names
  head_effect: whether serving the result needs a tag the author did not write
  negotiation: whether more than one representation lives under one URL
kinds:
  css:
    becomes: minified css, with static url() references rewritten to whatever their targets became
    source_ships: false
    url_change: false
    hook_needed: false
    reason: same name and same media type, so the tree walk replaces the bytes and no template is touched
    extra_outputs: none
    head_effect: none
    url_rewriting:
      why_here: the upstream seam rewrites template attributes and excludes css by its own non-goals, so a background-image can only be reached by the stylesheet pass this project owns
      scope: a static url() token in a stylesheet under the authored tree
      resolution: relative to the stylesheet's own location, never to the page that loads it
      out_of_scope: a url built from a custom property or any value not literal at build time, which is left alone and reported
      quoting: the token ends at the parenthesis outside quotes, since taking the first one would cut url("a (1).png") in half and emit a stylesheet that no longer parses
      ambiguous_absolute: an absolute reference matching two sources by suffix is left alone, because the mount prefix is runtime configuration and guessing would rewrite the wrong file
      inline_style_blocks: deferred 2026-08-05; a style block inside a template is not covered, and system:tinybind already rewrites those blocks for scoped styles, so a url pass there has a home and no design
      image_set: not generated, because policy:public-asset-media-negotiation answers the same question on the response and needs no css syntax
  png:
    becomes: webp, lossless axis; an avif variant, when produced, is lossless too
    source_ships: false when every reference to it was rewritten
    url_change: true
    hook_needed: true
    reference_sites: img src, and a css url() the stylesheet pass rewrites; nothing else
    naming: replace, so a.png becomes a.webp; the append form of the upstream seam is not used here because the source is not kept
    skip: a result larger than the source is a first-class skip with a reason, and the reference stays on the png
    negotiation: none by default; avif lossless is often no better than webp lossless on flat images
  jpeg:
    becomes: webp
    source_ships: false when every reference to it was rewritten
    url_change: true
    hook_needed: true
    reference_sites: same as png
    avif:
      produced: optional, as an additional representation of the same URL rather than a second URL
      attaches_to: whatever URL the image ends up at, converted or not, so a machine that can write avif and not webp still has something to offer under the URL the page already names
      chosen: per request from Accept, per policy:public-asset-media-negotiation
      why_the_server_and_not_the_markup: expressing the fallback in markup means a picture element, which this policy refuses to generate, so the choice has nowhere to live but the response
      cost: the URL says .webp while the bytes may be avif, so Content-Type is the only truth
  svg:
    becomes: optionally minified svg
    source_ships: false when minified, true otherwise
    url_change: false
    negotiation: none
    note: already covered by policy:public-asset-precompression, so the zstd sidecar is the larger win
  typescript_and_javascript:
    becomes: a bundled js for a ts entry, or a minified js for an authored js
    source_ships: false
    url_change: true for ts, false for a js minified in place
    hook_needed: true for ts; the js minify is tree-walk work like the css one
    naming: replace, so app.ts becomes app.js
    output_form:
      chosen: an es module, which is what a browser entry point is today and what the authored source is already written as
      requires: type=module on the tag
      why_not_decided_from_the_tag: the seam converts one distinct value once and replays it for every occurrence, so an output chosen from a template position would serve one page's answer to another; the transform is forbidden from reading the position for exactly this reason
      enforced_by: a build-time scan of every authored template, which refuses a built entry under a classic tag and names the file and line
      why_a_scan_is_enough: the constraint cannot be decided per occurrence and does not need to be; it only has to be checked, and every template is readable at once from the build
      rejected: an iife wrapper, which would run under either tag and silently give up top-level await to avoid a check that costs one pass over the templates
      unbundled_js: an authored js is transformed rather than bundled, so a module stays a module and its imports are untouched
    read_set: imports mean the digest of the named file is not the input; every file the build read is reported and hashed
    extra_outputs:
      source_map: written and named by no attribute
      css_companion: a css module imported by the entry produces a stylesheet the page must also load
    head_effect: the css companion needs a link the author never wrote, contributed by the conversion itself through the head field system:tinybind added in v0.3.5
  already_compact:
    kinds: webp, avif, woff2, mp4, wasm, archives
    becomes: itself
    source_ships: true
    action: verbatim copy, no precompression per policy:public-asset-precompression
  text_data:
    kinds: html, json, txt, xml, webmanifest, map
    becomes: itself
    source_ships: true
    action: copy and precompress
image_scope:
  in: img src, which is the only element this policy converts
  css: a url() the stylesheet pass rewrites, which reaches background-image without any markup change
  out: link rel icon, meta content, an image a script builds, and anything else naming an image, all of which pass through verbatim
  another_origin: a reference carrying a scheme, a protocol-relative prefix, or a data url is never claimed by a hook, since claiming it means resolving it under public and failing generation over a URL that was always correct
  no_picture:
    rule: the build never produces a picture, a source, or any other element the author did not write
    reason: wrapping an img changes descendant and sibling structure, so css combinators, flex and grid item identity, and structural javascript can all stop matching, and the build sees neither the global stylesheet nor the scripts to warn about it
    author_written: a picture the author wrote is ordinary markup; its img src is converted like any other and its source elements are left alone
  srcset:
    status: refused 2026-08-05
    expressible: a rewrite replaces the whole attribute string, so a transform could parse the descriptor list and reassemble it with no upstream change
    why_not: every URL in the list is a separate conversion and a partial failure has to leave the whole list authored, which is a second failure mode for an attribute a project writes when it is already making density decisions by hand
    consequence: a srcset keeps naming authored files, and those files stay in the tree because source_retention sees them
source_retention:
  rule: an authored source is dropped only when every reference the build can see was rewritten, and kept otherwise
  detection: a literal occurrence scan over the authored tree and the templates reports every remaining mention of a dropped URL
  unrewritable_reference: an occurrence the build cannot rewrite, such as one in a script or a meta tag, keeps the source in the tree instead of failing the build
  reported: both the drop and the retention are named in the build report, since a silently retained source looks like a conversion that did not happen
rules:
  - a kind whose URL does not change needs no template reference and therefore no generation hook, which is why the tree walk exists beside the hook
  - one source converts once no matter how many sites name it, so an image referenced by both an img and a stylesheet produces one output and one manifest entry
  - a transform never both rewrites a reference and leaves its source in the tree, unless source_retention kept it deliberately
  - skip is a result with a reason, not an error and not a silent no-op, and a skipped conversion is cached so a losing encode runs once
  - classification is this project's judgment; the upstream seam classifies nothing and ships no format table
  - a name never depends on encoder settings, per decision:derived-tree-development
  - a lossless source stays lossless in every representation of it, so an encoder that cannot hold the axis is not used for that source rather than used with a degraded result
  - determinism is per kind: identical bytes and settings produce identical outputs and identical names
non_goals:
  - generating a picture element or changing the element tree in any way
  - resizing, art direction, and density variants, which are authoring decisions rather than build ones
  - font subsetting
  - rewriting references inside javascript or markdown; css is in scope only through the stylesheet pass above
  - conversion at request time
```
