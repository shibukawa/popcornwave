title: Live Subscription Bounds
---
A live connection is bounded in lifetime, count, and cost, because it is the first response in the framework whose duration the server did not choose.

```yaml
status: implemented, except the per-boundary interval floor
source: requirement:live-html-rendering
extends: policy:async-render-bounds
client_key:
  rule: an authenticated subject where there is one, and the remote address otherwise
  why_not_the_session: no session identifier reaches a response path, and grouping every anonymous visitor into one bucket would refuse the second one
  known_weakness: clients behind one NAT share a bucket, so the anonymous bound is per address rather than per browser
  understated:
    fact: a proxy is not the corner case this weakness named; decision:local-tls-proxy-boundary makes a deployed listener see the proxy on every request, so the bound is one bucket per proxy node for every anonymous visitor
    effect: the fifth concurrent anonymous visitor of a proxied deployment is refused at the default of four, which bounds nothing and refuses ordinary traffic
    resolution: the client address of requirement:proxied-request-identity, which is the first consumer this policy owes that resolution
new_shape:
  fact: every other render is bounded by a request; a live connection is bounded by how long a browser tab stays open
  per_client_cost: one subscription is a goroutine, a source, and one rendered subtree per delivery, multiplied by the live boundaries on the screen
  authorization_drift: a session that expires or a permission that is revoked must stop a connection authorized minutes or hours ago
bounds:
  max_duration: a maximum response lifetime, after which the server closes with the retry record and expects requirement:live-connection-recovery to re-establish it
  jitter: spread each response's lifetime around the configured value, per response, so one restart does not produce a herd that repeats forever
  idle_close: a response with no delivery for a configured period is closed
  per_response_boundaries: a cap on live boundaries in one response, reported rather than truncated silently
  per_session_responses: a cap on concurrent live responses per session, so reopening cannot multiply subscriptions
  min_interval: deferred; a floor on how often one boundary may re-render is still an open question upstream about whether pacing is declared on the source or configured per deployment
  why_bounded_lifetime: it buys back authorization re-checks, deploy rollover, and load rebalancing; the price is one page execution per rollover
authorization:
  on_open: full authentication and authorization, never inherited from the document request
  on_resume: the page's own checks run again because the page runs again, which is what makes max_duration a security control and not only a resource one
  revocation: the server may end a connection when it observes revoked access, so the client sees a closed connection rather than content it believes is live
  no_privilege_carry: live mode grants nothing a document request for the same URL would not have granted
cancellation:
  client_gone: the request context cancels, every subscription on that response breaks its pull loop, and each source observes the cancellation through its context
  leak_rule: no source goroutine may outlive its request, which is why system:tinybind makes the leading context.Context mandatory on a live external
  shutdown: close live responses with the retry record rather than dropping them, so clients resume against the next instance
backpressure:
  mechanism: the pull sequence blocks the source in its own yield, so a fast source misses ticks rather than filling a queue
  slow_client: coalesces deliveries instead of growing a server-side buffer
  not_configurable: there is no delivery queue to size
concurrency:
  fact: htmlbind excludes live subscriptions from the await concurrency limit, so html.async_concurrency caps nothing here
  consequence: the useful unit is per process and per session, which this policy owns rather than the render option
degradation:
  refuse_live: declining live requests stops the screen from updating and leaves a valid document, because the committed content is what a client with no script already receives; shedding this load never produces an error page
  raise_min_interval: skipping deliveries is safe by construction under the whole-state delivery model, so the interval is a load dial
  both_cost_freshness: neither dial costs correctness
error_reporting:
  resolved: system:tinybind v0.2.8 hands a failure to the reporter after releasing the delivery lock, per requirement:live-error-report-off-lock, so a blocking reporter no longer stalls the subscription it is reporting on
  before: a reporter that blocked held the clause's goroutines and sources, and cancellation did not free them
  remaining: the reporter still takes no context, so it is the caller's job not to block forever; api:logger writes are what it does here
compression:
  fact: flushing every few seconds through a compressing encoder keeps a long-lived stream at a poor ratio and emits a sync marker per delivery
  secrets: a long-lived compressed stream mixing personalized content with anything request-influenced offers far more samples than one document does, so the decision:streaming-response-compression caution applies more strongly here
observability:
  counters: open live responses, live subscriptions, page executions spent on reconnects, deliveries rendered, and connections closed by reason
  per_boundary: render duration, because a periodic render is background load no request-latency metric will show
  labels: the response mode belongs in request logs and metric labels, since one route now mixes a document render with a long-lived stream
fan_out:
  render_is_per_client: reconstructed inputs and authorization differ per client, so nothing is shared by default
  source_is_shareable: one upstream feeding many subscriptions is the application's job inside the source
  cost_statement: N clients watching one gauge cost N renders per tick, which an operator must be able to predict from the interval and the client count
  breaker: a failing upstream is best contained inside the source, where the fallback is structural — the boundary keeps its last rendered content and the page stays correct
rules:
  - pass the request context to every live render so disconnect and shutdown stop it
  - close a bounded response with a terminal record, never by dropping the connection
  - jitter every configured lifetime
  - count a reconnect as a page execution in capacity planning, because that is what it costs
  - a live response is never cacheable and says so
configuration: data:html-render-config
open_questions:
  - default values for every bound, and whether any of them belongs on the render rather than in configuration
  - whether a per-boundary interval floor is declared in the template or configured per deployment
  - resolved: process-wide admission control is the process_wide scope of requirement:rate-limit-enforcement, not this policy; what stays here is the per-response bound, and the shedding valve is one layer out
```
