A translation carries named holes and never markup, and the framework hands system:tinybind an ordered list of text runs and hole markers rather than rendering anything itself.

```yaml
problem:
  what: a sentence whose middle is a link, an emphasis, or a button cannot be split into three messages without making it untranslatable
  naive_answer: allow markup in the translation
  why_that_fails: policy:template-escaping admits trust only through explicit constructors and ships no raw output helper; a translation is authored outside the repository review path and would become the one string that escapes that rule
rules:
  - a translation is plain text plus named holes, never markup
  - the element wrapping a hole is written in the template and bound at the reference
  - a hole named in a translation and unbound at the reference is reported at generation
  - a hole bound at the reference and named by no translation is reported, because the element would never render
  - the rules of policy:template-escaping apply unchanged to the bound element, since it is ordinary template markup
spelling_as_built:
  form: a block, closed by its own terminator
  written: "{t agree}<a href=\"/start\"></a>{/t}"
  hole_name: the bound element's own tag, so a translation spelling a hole as an anchor lines up with the template writing an anchor and the hole-name concept stays invisible
  override: a hole attribute, needed only where two holes in one reference share a tag
  bound_element_is_written_empty: its children position becomes the translated text inside the hole
  not_what_was_requested: an inline binding list on the reference; the block was chosen upstream 2026-08-16 and the tag-as-name rule came with it
positions:
  legal: where structural children are legal
  illegal: inside an attribute value, because this form produces structure rather than a string
  contrast: an ordinary reference stays a string expression and is legal anywhere an expression is
  why_the_split_is_acceptable: an author reaching for markup inside an attribute value has no valid form to reach for in any case
what_the_framework_produces:
  shape: an ordered list of text runs and hole markers, one entry per segment
  arguments: interpolated inside the generated function, so a run is complete before it leaves
  carrier_type: the upstream segment type, because the generated function is the argument of the upstream message op and its signature is fixed by that call
  corrected_2026_08_16: this file previously claimed no upstream type is returned, which reading the emitter disproved; what is never returned is markup or a writer, and the segment type is the agreed data carrier rather than an exception to the boundary
  never_returned: markup, a writer, or anything that renders
  interleaving: done upstream, which renders its own ops around each marker exactly as it renders children
  why_this_direction: decision:message-code-shape records the inversion and what it bought
escaping_has_no_exception:
  fact: a text run is escaped upstream for the position it lands in, like every other value
  consequence: the boundary claim of decision:upstream-message-surface that escaping is unchanged holds for every message form with no carve-out
  what_it_replaced: an earlier design in which literal text between holes never passed the upstream escaper and the obligation moved downstream
what_a_translator_can_do:
  - move a hole within the sentence, which is the reordering translation exists for
  - change the text inside and outside a hole
what_a_translator_cannot_do:
  - add an element, an attribute, a URL, or a handler
  - change what a hole renders as
unbound_hole_at_render:
  behavior: the translated text is written without its markup
  why_not_a_failure: dropping the segment would lose the sentence, and the reader can act on missing emphasis in a way they cannot act on missing words
  relationship_to_the_rules_above: generation already reported it, so this is what a build that ignored the report renders rather than a supported mode
cost: one slice per rich-text reference per render; an ordinary message allocates nothing, per decision:message-code-shape
```
