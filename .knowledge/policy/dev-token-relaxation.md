title: Development Token Relaxation Policy
---
Under `pw dev` a hand-written token is admitted without a signature, so requirement:jwt-only-api-authentication can be developed against with no authorization server running; every lock below exists because this is the one setting that turns authentication off.

```yaml
purpose: a developer holding curl and a text editor, not a test, which api:testutil-auth already serves without relaxing anything
locks:
  all_required: the relaxed path runs only when every lock below is open at once, and each is checked independently
  build:
    mechanism: the reserved pwdev build mode of decision:development-public-assets
    effect: the relaxed verifier is a separate file behind the tag, so a production build does not contain the code rather than merely not reaching it
    consequence: api:cli-build already rejects a build whose graph carries a development-only package, and this keeps that check meaningful
  environment:
    rule: refuse startup when data:runtime-environment resolves to stg, prod, or production, matching policy:devidp-safety
  configuration:
    field: auth.jwt.dev.trust_unverified_tokens, default false
    reason: data:runtime-environment states that the token is data rather than a feature switch, so APP_ENV dev alone must not turn this on
    outside_pwdev: a binary built without the tag fails startup when it sees the field, rather than ignoring it, for the reason data:authentication-runtime-config gives about silently ignored security settings
  network:
    rule: the request must arrive from a loopback address, with no opt-out, matching the listen rule of policy:devidp-safety
    remote_testing: use requirement:contrib-devidp, which signs, rather than opening this to a device on the network
relaxed:
  signature: not checked
  issuer: iss may be absent or may name anything
  audience: aud may be absent or may name anything
  token_type: typ is not checked
  time: exp, iat, and nbf may be absent, and a stale or future value is accepted
  lifetime_sanity: not applied
  algorithms: the allowlist is not consulted
  form: one switch rather than a menu of toggles, because a per-check menu is a thing to get half right
not_relaxed:
  identity: the auth.jwt.identity_claim value must be present and non-empty, or there is no identity to publish
  admission: policy:bearer-admission runs unchanged, so a developer exercises the real organization rule rather than a bypass of it
  revocation: policy:token-revocation runs unchanged, so the revocation path is developed against too
  bounds: auth.jwt.max_token_bytes and the requirement:contrib-jwt parser bounds still apply, because a decoder is a decoder
  shape: the credential is still a compact JWT with a decodable claim set; a bare JSON body is not a credential
  empty_signature:
    problem: an alg none token is conventionally written with an empty third segment, and the requirement:contrib-jwt parser refuses that, correctly, because a token with no signature is not one the verifier should ever look at
    resolution: the relaxed path substitutes a placeholder signature before parsing and ignores what it decoded to, rather than weakening the parser or writing a second one
    scope: the substitution lives in the build-tagged file, so no build without the tag contains it
  identity_time: a hand-written token usually carries no iat, so the relaxed path stamps the identity with now; the subject form of policy:token-revocation compares against that value, and leaving it zero would skip the comparison rather than fail it
no_alg_none:
  rule: the relaxed path never calls the verifier, and the verifier never gains a branch for alg none
  reason: an accepted alg none is a hole in the production code path that a configuration mistake can reach; a separate path behind a build tag is not
  consequence: policy:access-token-verification keeps refusing alg none unconditionally, and this policy does not qualify that sentence
visibility:
  startup: a warning at every startup naming the mode, the environment, and the loopback restriction, matching the devidp warning
  request: every admitted request carries X-Pw-Auth-Unverified, so a client and a proxy log can both see it
  log: each relaxed admission is logged at warn level with the subject, rate-limited so a request loop does not bury the rest of the log
  doctor: rule:production-readiness-checks reports the field as an error wherever it appears in a configuration file for a non-dev environment
rules:
  - the relaxed result is an ordinary data:request-authentication, so handler code does not learn that it was relaxed and cannot come to depend on it
  - a token that fails to decode is refused here as it is anywhere; relaxation removes checks, it does not add tolerance for malformed input
  - api:cli-init writes the field into config.dev.toml and no other environment file, for the api-server preset only, per requirement:api-server-scaffold; this replaces the earlier rule that it never scaffolds the field, which followed from decision:jwt-only-mode-not-scaffolded and which decision:jwt-only-preset-scaffolding amends
  - the framework never derives this setting from a header, a query parameter, or a request property
non_goals:
  - a relaxation for staging, a demo deployment, or a CI environment reachable by anything but loopback
  - relaxing verification for any browser mode of data:authentication-runtime-config, which has requirement:contrib-devidp instead
  - a test seam; api:testutil-auth constructs an authenticated request directly and needs no verifier at all
```
