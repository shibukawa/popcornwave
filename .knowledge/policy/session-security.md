title: Session Security Policy
---
The session token is unguessable, rotated at every authentication-strength change, and safe in diagnostics, whatever the session carries.

```yaml
scope: the token and the storage that hangs off it; the bounds it enforces are declared by decision:session-lifetime-owned-by-auth
token:
  entropy: at least 256 random bits
  browser_value: canonical opaque encoding
  store_key: cryptographic hash of browser value
cookie_defaults:
  http_only: true
  secure: true outside explicit loopback development
  same_site: lax
  path: /
lifetime:
  declared_by: data:authentication-runtime-config, under auth.session
  enforced_by: api:session-manager and flow:session-lifecycle
  shape: an absolute expiry and an optional idle expiry, both authoritative on the server
account_revocation:
  rule: ending an account ends the sessions already issued to it, without waiting for their expiry
  reason: data:user-account Suspended is read where a session is created, and a request that already has one creates nothing, so a check placed only at admission never runs again for the sessions that matter
  mechanism: the account behind a live session is re-read through the installed AccountLookup where data:request-authentication is derived
  why_not_a_stamp: an epoch compared against the session still has to be fetched from somewhere to be compared against, and the application already publishes exactly one way to ask about an account
  bound: 30 seconds per account, cached in process; reading on every request would put a store round trip in front of every authenticated page
  honesty: that interval is the answer to how fast a suspension reaches a live session, and there is no other
  immediate: auth.ForgetAccount drops the cached answer, which is process-local, so a multi-instance deployment still waits the interval elsewhere
  ended: a suspended or removed account has its session destroyed on the spot and the request continues anonymous, so the browser stops carrying a session nothing will honour
  unavailable: a store that cannot answer produces 503 rather than an admission or a denial, because the credential was not judged and admitting on an outage would make every suspension conditional on the account store being up
  no_lookup_installed: nothing to re-read and nothing refused, which is honest for a deployment that keeps no local account table
login_slot_placement:
  rule: a deployment that authenticates outside dev is told when its session backend cannot revoke, and decides
  reason: under the cookie backend the login rotation promotes nothing, because the destination is where the value already is, so logout expires the client copy while a copy taken beforehand keeps authenticating to its sealed expiry, and account_revocation above has the same shape
  mechanism: plugin/auth setup warns on session.backend = cookie, and rule:production-readiness-checks reports it as PW0506 against the configuration
  dev: silent rather than quieter, because the pairing is the correct one there, where a login needing no infrastructure is the point and the exposure needs a browser someone else is holding; a warning printed on every local run is one an operator learns to scroll past, and this has to still be readable the day it appears in a staging log
  why_not_a_refusal: the deployment is the only party that knows whether it can live without ending a session on demand, and refusing would take the cheapest backend away from the case it was built for
  why_not_serveronly: the session package already refuses that backend for a session.ServerOnly slot, but the slot is registered from an init that cannot see whether auth is enabled, and that refusal has no environment in it
  slot_stays_private: plugin/auth writes its slot only through establish at login, so the anonymous phase stores nothing either way and the placement buys nothing the warning does not
rules:
  - rotate after login, privilege change, and other authentication-strength changes
  - authentication-strength change includes the re-proof of policy:reauthentication, which also resets idle expiry
  - rotation changes the token and preserves every registered slot, so fixation resistance costs no application state
  - expiry is a bound on the whole session, not a substitute for the per-operation assurance of concept:assurance-axes
  - revoke server state on logout, and destroy every slot with it
  - enforce absolute expiry and optional idle expiry whenever a lifetime source declares them
  - a session with no lifetime source is bounded by the browser alone, which decision:session-lifetime-owned-by-auth accepts and reports at startup
  - protect state-changing cookie-authorized requests with policy:csrf-protection, whether or not the request is authenticated
  - never log cookie values, token hashes, stored slot data, or backend credentials
  - reject insecure SameSite none cookies
  - bind authorization to validated data:request-authentication, never cookie presence alone
  - a session existing for an anonymous browser is not an authentication claim, so it grants nothing
  - sqlite://:memory: is process-local and unsuitable for multi-process production sessions
  - a cookie-backed record is sealed under policy:cookie-value-protection and bound to the hash of its own token
  - a cookie backend cannot revoke an issued record, so a deployment that must end sessions on demand uses a server-side store
  - state that must be revocable declares session.ServerOnly rather than trusting the configured backend, per decision:slot-declared-placement
  - an anonymous session.Private slot is unrevocable while it is a cookie, which is accepted because revocation has no meaning before a login
  - promotion moves a value from the client to the server and never the reverse, so a logout hands the browser nothing back
```
