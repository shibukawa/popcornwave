title: Shared Device Mode
---
A deployment whose browsers are shared declares it once, and the settings that would otherwise leave one user visible to the next are refused rather than left to be found individually.

```yaml
field: auth.shared_device, bool, default false
status: implemented
implemented:
  prompt: the login endpoint sends login alone rather than select_account and login when this is set
  logout: Config.validate refuses the mode beside a reconfirm logout_scope rather than overriding it
  hint: Config.validate refuses the mode beside an enabled policy:session-downgrade hint
  abandonment: requirement:presence-signal is the answer to the limit below, and a deployment turning this mode on should turn that on too
default_meaning: not declared shared, rather than asserted personal
implications:
  no_hint: policy:session-downgrade is disabled, so the browser leaves the active level for anonymous directly
  global_logout: policy:provider-session-scope is fixed to global, so an explicit logout ends the provider session
  no_select_account: the prompt list of policy:reauthentication carries login without select_account
coupling:
  reason: the three are one requirement and not three, because any one alone achieves nothing
  worked_example: disabling the hint while logout stays reconfirm leaves the provider session alive, so the next visitor still sees the previous account in the provider's own account picker
  supplier: the division_of_memory of policy:session-downgrade shows that the account name comes from the provider, so removing the local half removes the half that was not doing the disclosing
third_implication:
  case: the common end of a session on a shared device is abandonment rather than logout
  effect: the local session expires while the provider session remains, so the next visitor reaches the login screen with the provider still holding the previous user
  response: never send select_account, because it exists to surface exactly what this mode is trying to hide
limits:
  abandonment: prompt=login re-authenticates but does not make the provider forget, and only an explicit logout can end the provider session, so an abandoned session stays partly exposed
  no_rp_remedy: nothing a relying party sends can end a provider session it was not asked to end
  remaining_controls: a short session idle timeout under data:session-runtime-config, and the provider's own session lifetime, which the deployment configures at the provider
  idle_timeout_is_weaker_than_it_reads: idle expiry measures time since the last request rather than since a person acted, and a page holding a live connection keeps touching the session on its own, so an abandoned browser can outlast the timeout entirely
  wanted: requirement:presence-signal, which makes abandonment observable and is the missing half of this mode
  honesty: this mode reduces disclosure and does not eliminate it, and must not be described as if it did
validation:
  principle: refuse a conflicting field rather than overriding it, following the mode_validation principle of data:authentication-runtime-config
  refused_when_true:
    - auth.assurance.hint.enabled true
    - auth.oidc.logout_scope reconfirm
  reason: a silently overridden setting leaves a configuration file that reads as one behavior while the deployment runs another
granularity:
  scope: the whole deployment, because the framework has no signal telling one browser from another
  not_offered: per-user or per-device selection, which needs the device trust signals requirement:session-assurance-levels lists as a non-goal
  consequence: a deployment serving both shared terminals and personal laptops chooses the stricter setting or runs two deployments
```
