title: A Gap Is An Absent Declaration, Not A Stub
---
Where a surface cannot yet be implemented on a backend, the declaration is left out rather than provided as something that compiles and does nothing, so the gap is a build error at the call site.

```yaml
applies_to: api:pwfast-package first, and any second implementation of a surface this framework already ships
rule: no stub that compiles, no panic-on-call placeholder, no silent no-op
why:
  same_contract_everywhere: decision:transport-compatibility-fallback records that a function the rewriter cannot take is a build error rather than a slower route; a stub would answer the same question the opposite way, in the same build
  a_stub_is_discovered_late: it compiles at the call site and fails in production, or worse succeeds while doing nothing, which is the failure mode a partial update surface would have
  the_message_is_better: an undefined identifier names the exact symbol and the exact line, which is what the upstream refusal diagnostics ask of a refusal
  it_keeps_the_gap_counted: absence is visible to a compiler and to a reader; a stub has to be remembered
what_replaces_the_stub:
  documentation: the package doc names what is missing and why, so the build error has an explanation to be read against
  catalog: a requirement recording the plan, so the gap is work rather than an omission
not_this:
  panicking_placeholder: it moves the failure from build time to request time, which is strictly worse for the same amount of code
  returning_an_error: it makes an unimplementable call look like a runtime condition an application should handle
  silently_doing_nothing: the worst of the three, because a partial update response is indistinguishable from a working one until a user reports it
exception:
  none_yet: a surface whose absence would break generated code rather than application code would be argued separately, since generation can be made not to emit the call
```
