title: Reauthentication Policy

Re-proof refreshes the assurance of the session already in the browser, so it either ends on the same account or fails closed.

```yaml
same_identity:
  check: the identity the re-proof verified resolves to the account the session already holds
  compare: the issuer, key claim, and key of data:external-identity, or the credential owner for a passkey
  mismatch: fail closed, leave the original session unchanged, and never offer a silent account switch
  reason: a step-up that accepts any successful login is an account swap with the previous account's guarded operation already staged
provider_request:
  max_age: send the remaining age budget, so an old single sign-on session at the provider does not satisfy the request
  verify: verify auth_time in the returned ID Token rather than trusting that the provider honored max_age
  missing_auth_time: treat as a failed re-proof, because OpenID Connect requires auth_time whenever max_age was sent
  untouched: the provider session itself, which only policy:provider-session-scope global mode ends
prompt_values:
  login: re-authenticate the end user, returning login_required when the provider cannot
  select_account: show the accounts the provider holds sessions for, which is the identified level of concept:assurance-axes supplied by the provider rather than by local state
  consent: re-approve the grant of this client, which re-confirms authorization rather than identity
  combining: prompt is a space-delimited list, so login and select_account may travel together; none may not be combined with anything
  relation: most providers collapse max_age=0 into prompt=login, so a deployment sends max_age for a budget and prompt for an interaction it wants regardless of age
  unverifiable: prompt is a SHOULD, and no claim reports whether the provider honored it, so a relying party cannot check the outcome
  consequence: a freshness requirement rests on max_age and the verified auth_time; prompt is an interaction hint beside it and never the proof
  trap: a step-up built on prompt=login alone counts a silently reused single sign-on session as a completed re-proof
  safe_use: policy:provider-session-scope reconfirm mode, where prompt failing costs a user-experience improvement and nothing more
  withheld: select_account is omitted entirely under policy:shared-device-mode, because it exists to surface what that mode hides
session_effect:
  - rotate the token, because an assurance change is an authentication-strength change under policy:session-security
  - rotation is revoke-and-create, so idle and absolute expiry both restart, per data:session-assurance-state
  - preserve the account, the external identity link, and the application payload
  - update data:session-assurance-state within the same rotation
  - rotate the policy:csrf-protection secret with the session
failure:
  - a failed or abandoned re-proof leaves the original session at its previous assurance
  - the guarded operation is not performed, and its staged intent is discarded on expiry
  - repeated failures are rate-limited per session and per account, through the failure_counting surface of requirement:rate-limit-enforcement rather than a middleware, because what is counted is an outcome no middleware has seen yet
rules:
  - re-proof never provisions an account, never links an identity, and never changes an admission decision
  - policy:oidc-admission still evaluates, so an identity that lost admission fails re-proof instead of refreshing it
  - passkey re-proof requires user verification when the deployment configured it, per policy:passkey-security
  - the recent strong proof policy:account-linking and policy:account-recovery already require is this policy, not a second mechanism
  - audit each attempt with account, method, outcome, and reason, and without tokens, claims, credential IDs, or cookie values
  - a cookie backend cannot revoke the pre-rotation record, per decision:cookie-session-storage, so a copy taken earlier keeps its old assurance until its sealed expiry
```
