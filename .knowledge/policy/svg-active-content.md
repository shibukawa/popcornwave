title: SVG Active Content
---

A served SVG is neutralised by the response header rather than by understanding it, and the build scan on top only names the obvious cases so an author hears about them.

```yaml
why_svg_is_the_exception:
  every_other_image: a png or a webp is decoded by an image decoder and has no script surface at all
  svg: is xml with a script element, event handlers, and its own animation language, so image/svg+xml from the application origin executes in that origin on direct navigation
  not_covered_by_the_sibling: the file is honest, so policy:asset-content-signature has nothing to report; the extension and the bytes agree and the content is still active
  where_it_bites: direct navigation to the asset URL, and object, embed, or iframe; an img never runs script and was never the exposure
boundary_is_the_header:
  header: api:public-asset-middleware sends Content-Security-Policy sandbox on a response whose media type is image/svg+xml
  why_this_is_the_primary: it needs no parse, no table, and no judgment about content, so it holds for every svg including the ones no build ever read
  covers: an svg under server.public.read_local, one the allow list exempted, one committed after the last build, and one the scan below simply missed
  effect: unique origin and no script, so an svg that does execute cannot reach the application origin
  invisible_to_img: an img neither ran script nor needed the origin, so nothing that already worked changes
  breaks: an svg deliberately served interactive through object, embed, or direct navigation, which is why it is a switch and not a constant
  lighter_alternative: script-src none, which blocks execution without the unique origin; sandbox is the default because the origin is the part worth taking away
  composition:
    with_the_application_policy: policy:security-response-headers owns the configured application CSP, so this header is added beside it rather than replacing it
    semantics: two CSP headers are both enforced and the effective policy is their intersection, so the sandbox can only tighten what the application declared
    implementation: Add, never Set, since Set on the same field would drop the application policy on every asset response
build_scan:
  status: best effort, deliberately, and not a security boundary; the header above is the boundary and this is how an author finds out before shipping
  method: a case-insensitive literal scan of the bytes the tree walk already holds
  looks_for:
    script_element: the literal "<script"
    event_handler: an attribute name matching on followed by letters and an equals sign
    script_url: the literal "javascript:"
  severity: error, so the file is refused rather than merely mentioned, with the allow list of policy:asset-content-signature as the way to keep one on purpose
  false_positive: an svg with those characters in ordinary text, such as a diagram labelling javascript:, which the allow list resolves in one line
not_detected:
  by_design: everything needing a parse, which is where the cost stops being worth it
  examples:
    - a smil set or animate assigning a script url through attributeName, which carries no literal handler
    - a handler or url arriving entity-encoded, through cdata, or under a namespace prefix
    - foreignObject holding html, and an external entity in a doctype
    - an off-origin image, use, or feImage reference, which discloses a viewer rather than executing
  why_that_is_acceptable: each of these is answered by the sandbox header whether or not the build recognised it, so the missing half of the scan costs a warning and not an exposure
  reconsider_when: the header has to be switched off for a project, which is the one configuration where the scan would be carrying the weight alone
sanitisation_refused:
  what_was_rejected: stripping the active constructs at build time and shipping the remainder
  reasons:
    - it makes this project own an svg sanitiser, a security-critical surface that is never finished and is wrong quietly
    - it rewrites bytes the author wrote, which is the invariant requirement:derived-asset-pipeline holds everywhere else
    - a stripped file still looks like the file the author committed, so the next edit puts the construct back and nothing says so
  instead: refuse, name the literal that matched and its offset, and let the author decide
separate_origin_refused:
  what_was_rejected: serving svg from its own hostname, which is the complete answer
  reason: the mount of data:server-runtime-config is a path prefix, so a second origin is a deployment the framework cannot provision or verify
  note: an operator who does have one loses nothing here; the sandbox header is redundant then rather than wrong
```
