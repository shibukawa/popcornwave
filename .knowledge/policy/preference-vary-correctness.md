title: Preference Vary Correctness
---
A response varies on exactly the preference signals it read, never on viewport width, and never at all when it read none.

```yaml
problem:
  what: one URL gains a representation per preference value the server built with
  failure: a shared cache with no Vary serves one reader's theme to the next reader
  opposite_failure: a Vary applied to every response collapses shared-cache hit rate for pages that never read a preference
  precedent: decision:bot-client-classification scoped Vary User-Agent to responses whose chain reports an await block for this reason; this policy applies the same scoping to a different signal
rules:
  - emit Vary for a signal only when api:user-preference-accessors resolved from it on this request
  - emit no preference Vary when every accessor reported absent, so an unread page keeps its cacheable unvaried response
  - emit Vary on the preference cookie when the override decided the value
  - emit Vary on the hint header when the hint decided the value
  - never emit Vary on Sec-CH-Viewport-Width or Sec-CH-Width, under any configuration
  - a signal listed in Critical-CH must also appear in Accept-CH and in Vary on that response, which the emission of data:preference-hint-config guarantees
  - values compose with the Vary already set by decision:streaming-response-compression and decision:bot-client-classification rather than replacing it
viewport_width_is_never_varied_on:
  why: the value is a near-continuous integer, so each distinct window size is its own cached representation and a shared cache misses on nearly every request
  effect_if_ignored: the page is not slightly less cacheable, it is effectively uncacheable, which is a worse outcome than the sizing it was read for
  what_reading_it_is_still_for: asset and srcset selection under policy:asset-transform-matrix, where the chosen asset varies and the document does not
  consequence: a handler that branches document markup on width produces a response this policy cannot make correct, which is why decision:preference-signal-precedence refuses that branch rather than varying on it
cost:
  color_scheme: two representations per varying page, which is the price of a server-chosen theme attribute
  private_responses: an authenticated page is already private under policy:layered-cache, so the Vary costs it nothing
  static_pages: unaffected, because they read nothing
  measurement: an operator comparing hit rate before and after should see movement only on pages that read a preference
interaction:
  fragment: api:html-fragment-response follows the same rule, since a swap response is cached on the same terms
  component_layer: a cached component under policy:layered-cache includes a resolved preference in its key only when it was built with one
rationale: correctness is derived from what ran rather than declared by the author, because a declaration that must be remembered is the one that is forgotten
```
