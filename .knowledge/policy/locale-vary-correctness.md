title: Locale Vary Correctness
---
A route in a negotiated mode varies on its negotiation inputs on every response, whether or not this request carried them, because language has no correct default representation.

```yaml
problem:
  what: one URL gains a representation per locale under decision:locale-url-modes cookie and header modes
  failure_if_read_driven:
    sequence:
      - a reader with no cookie requests the page, the cookie is absent, nothing is recorded, no Vary is emitted
      - a shared cache stores the response without a Vary
      - a reader whose cookie says another locale receives the stored copy
    outcome: a page in a language the reader cannot read
why_the_preference_rule_does_not_transfer:
  preference_rule: policy:preference-vary-correctness emits a Vary only for a signal an accessor resolved from on that request
  what_makes_it_safe_there: decision:preference-signal-precedence records that CSS answers the unoverridden case, so the response built without the signal is correct for every reader and an unvaried cached copy harms nobody
  what_is_missing_here: there is no floor; the response built without the signal is one locale's text, which is wrong content for the readers this exists for
  conclusion: the same mechanism with a different failure, so this is a separate rule rather than an exception to that one
rules:
  - a path mode route emits no locale Vary, because the URL already separates the representations
  - a cookie mode route emits Vary on the locale cookie and on Accept-Language, on every response
  - a header mode route emits Vary on Accept-Language, on every response
  - the values compose with the Vary already set by decision:streaming-response-compression, decision:bot-client-classification, and api:problem-response rather than replacing it
  - a negotiation redirect emits Vary on Accept-Language and uses 302, since a permanent status would cache one reader's negotiation for the next
derived_from_configuration_not_from_reads:
  fact: the mode declaration of data:i18n-config states what a route negotiates on before any request arrives
  effect: no request-scoped accumulation is needed for this signal
  requirement: the locale is resolved before the first byte, which routing already does; a lazy resolution at the first message reference would be too late under flow:initial-streaming-render
mechanism:
  carrier: the vary axis of a data:locale-bindings entry, folded into the response vary by system:tinybind through the path a builtin element already uses
  emitted_by_reach: a response carries the axis when its render actually reached the binding, which is narrower than the route declaration and never wider
  why_that_is_still_unconditional_enough: every response of a negotiated route that renders text reaches the binding, so the reach walk and the route declaration agree wherever it matters; a page reaching neither renders no localized content and needs no axis
  path_mode: an empty axis on every binding, which is the declaration an application carrying the value in its URL makes
  no_downstream_vary_code: the axis is data on a binding declaration rather than a header this project writes, so there is one place a mode can be wrong
cache_key_is_the_other_half:
  fact: a cached component keys on the bindings it reaches, per data:locale-bindings
  why_both_are_needed: the vary axis protects a cache outside the response, and the key protects the component cache inside it; either alone leaves one reader's locale reachable by another
  precedent_replaced: the rule that a locale-varying component must take the locale as a declared parameter or not be cached, which was written when a parameter was the only way to carry such a value
cost:
  cookie_mode: Vary on Cookie splits the cache per session, since HTTP cannot vary on one cookie
  honest_reading: that is what private content already is under policy:layered-cache, so an authenticated route pays nothing new
  public_content_in_a_negotiated_mode: gives up shared caching entirely, which is the reason decision:locale-url-modes points public content at the path mode
no_collector_middleware:
  considered: a middleware assembling every Vary contribution
  why_not_possible: headers are final before the body under flow:initial-streaming-render, and data:request-context-capsule fixes its fields at handler dispatch
  why_not_needed: of the contributing signals, compression derives from configuration under decision:response-encoders-are-unconditional, representation from the route under api:problem-response, render branch from the plan under decision:bot-client-classification, and locale from a binding declaration under this policy; only api:user-preference-accessors is read-driven
  what_remains: composition at write time, which policy:preference-vary-correctness already names
fixed_set_rejected:
  shape: always declaring Accept and Accept-Encoding
  why_not: the opposite_failure of policy:preference-vary-correctness, which collapses hit rate for responses that answer one way
  near_miss: Accept-Encoding derives from configuration and is on in most deployments, so the outcome resembles a fixed set without being one
```
