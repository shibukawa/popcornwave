title: CLI Progress Reporting
---
A system:pw-cli command reports the work an operator is waiting on while it runs, and finishes by naming what the operator now owns rather than what the toolchain produced for itself.

```yaml
audience: actor:application-developer
problem:
  silence: api:cli-dev spends its startup on services, generation, migration, and a build with no output, so a slow run and a hung run look identical
  wrong_nouns: api:cli-init ends by listing the policy:generated-artifacts paths, which are gitignored build inputs named after sources the operator has not read yet, so the one list it prints is the one list that answers no question
progress_region:
  applies_to: any phase that can outlast a second, which today means service startup, api:cli-generate, api:cli-migrate, the CSS build, and the Go build
  form: a bounded region of about three lines, holding the phase in progress and the last lines under it
  lifetime: the region is replaced in place as phases advance and collapses to the outcome when the command reaches its steady state
  reason: a scrollback full of every generated path costs the operator the diagnostics that follow it, and a phase name with a spinner answers "is it stuck" without any of that
  never_collapsed: diagnostics, warnings, and errors leave the region and stay in the scrollback, because the region exists to hide routine progress and nothing else
  non_terminal: plain one-line-per-phase output with no cursor movement, so a log file and CI transcript stay readable
  library: the decision:interactive-project-bootstrap terminal stack, host-only per decision:host-tools-target-runtime
completion_report:
  names: the handwritten sources the command created or edited, grouped by concept:project-layout directory
  counts: policy:generated-artifacts files are reported as a count with the command that recreates them, never as a path list
  reason: a generated path is not a file the operator opens, edits, or commits, and the ignore rule the same scaffold writes already says so
  errors: unchanged, since a failing generation reports the source it could not compile whatever the progress region is doing
commands:
  init: progress region over its phases, then the created-source report, then the decision:interactive-project-bootstrap declined-capability notice and the next commands
  dev: progress region over the startup phases, collapsing into policy:startup-summary and the watch loop; a rebuild reuses the same region
  generate: the path list is the whole output of the command, so it stays a list when invoked directly and becomes a count when another command runs it
  build: progress region over generation and compilation
non_goals:
  - a progress bar with a percentage, which no phase here can honestly compute
  - a full-screen process manager, refused for the same reason api:cli-dev keeps service logs in one stream
  - hiding any diagnostic behind an interactive control
```
