title: Live Connection Recovery
---
A screen whose live connection drops re-establishes it by re-requesting the same page in live mode, repainting only the live regions and nothing else.

```yaml
status: implemented in the runtime script requirement:external-boundary-runtime ships
source: requirement:live-html-rendering
protocol: api:live-delivery-protocol
transport: decision:live-delivery-transport
why_it_is_the_common_case: a connection held for as long as a tab stays open is closed by a proxy, a sleep, a deploy, and by policy:live-subscription-bounds itself, so reconnect is the steady state rather than the exception
same_path:
  rule: the first live request and every reconnect are the same request to the same route
  consequence: no second mechanism can drift from the first, and the server holds no per-client state a reconnect has to find
  authorization: the page's own check runs again, because the page runs again
selectivity:
  transferred: live boundary deliveries only
  untouched: static regions, settled await boundaries, and every ancestor receive nothing and cannot repaint
  mechanism: skipping the body transfer, so the client never names what to preserve
missed_deliveries:
  behavior: deliveries produced while disconnected are not queued and not replayed
  safe_because: a delivery carries the whole state of its region, so the next one is sufficient
  visible_cost: a chat list shows the current list after a reconnect, with no arrival animation for what was missed
first_delivery: always sent in the first milestone, even when it matches what the client already displays, because the client sends no validator to suppress it
unknown_boundary_id:
  meaning: the ids are positional and the page executed again, so an id the client does not hold means the page structure itself changed
  action: stop the connection and reload the page once
  not_an_alert:
    upstream_suggestion: tell the user to reload, with a plain alert as a defensible first implementation
    chosen_instead: reload once, guarded per URL in session storage, because an alert leaves the screen in the state that caused it and asks the user to do what the runtime can do itself
    why_the_guard_is_enough: the reload is what a user told to reload would do anyway, and the guard is what stops a server that keeps producing the condition from looping
  why_not_reconcile: inserting a boundary correctly means placing it in a document the client did not render, which is the flow:partial-refresh problem rather than the reconnect one
  why_not_silent: ignoring it leaves the user watching a screen missing a region the server believes is there
when_to_connect:
  from_document: the api:live-delivery-protocol document marker says whether live work remains, so a page with no live boundary opens nothing
  truncated_document:
    detection: readyState says when the question can be answered and the marker says what the answer is
    loading: bytes are still arriving and the marker may be among them, so nothing is decided
    complete_with_marker: an ordinary end, whatever the marker's state says about live work
    complete_without_marker: the document was cut off
    never_streamed: a document with no boundary placeholder and no applied range carries no marker either, so it is excluded rather than treated as truncated
    trigger: readystatechange, plus one check when the runtime loads, since a module imported after the document settled sees no further event
    recovery: reload, rather than open a live connection, which repairs neither a stranded fallback nor lost body content
    guard: one reload per URL, so a server truncating every response cannot produce a loop
  from_live: a retry close, or a stream that ended with no terminal record
  never_from_transport: load, DOMContentLoaded, readyState, and a resolved fetch reader are not completion signals on their own
retry_policy:
  keyed_on_reason: the terminal record already distinguishes the cases, so one backoff for all of them would stall a healthy screen on every lifetime rollover
  closed_retry: reconnect promptly with jitter
  truncation_or_error: exponential backoff with jitter and a cap
  closed_done: no reconnect
  reload: no reconnect; instruct a reload
  storm: a restart or a rolling deploy reconnects every client at once, and each reconnect is a page execution, so jitter is required rather than optional
navigation_ordering:
  rule: the client aborts its live request before applying a same-document navigation
  why: aborting surfaces no further records, so a delivery for the outgoing page cannot land after the incoming one, whatever is still in flight
  full_navigation: aborts by itself
  server_view: an ordinary request cancellation
duplicate_connections:
  case: a client opens a new connection before the previous one is torn down server-side
  behavior: both are valid; the older one's deliveries are indistinguishable from the newer one's until boundary revisions exist
  gap: without a revision, an in-flight delivery from the older connection can repaint a region with older content
  containment: the abort rule above plus the short life of the overlap, until the record carries a revision
hidden_tab: pausing or closing the connection is client policy; reconnect is what makes closing it attractive, at the price of one page execution when the tab returns
acceptance:
  - a dropped connection is re-established against the same URL with no separate endpoint involved
  - a dashboard with one live region and several static ones transfers nothing for the static ones
  - boundary ids from a reconnect address the DOM the document render created, with nothing sent to align them
  - a page whose render produced no live boundary opens no connection and costs no speculative page execution
  - a truncated document is detected from the missing marker rather than from a timeout
  - a generated-version change across a deploy instructs a reload rather than applying records to a document that no longer matches
  - an unknown boundary id stops the connection instead of guessing
open_questions:
  - whether a long outage should prefer a full reload over a reconnect, given a truncated document already prefers one
  - whether the server suggests a reconnect delay on the retry record, which is the only way to spread load before anything fails
  - whether a later milestone sends per-boundary revisions so an unchanged first delivery can be suppressed
```
