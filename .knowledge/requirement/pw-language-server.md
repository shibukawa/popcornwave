title: Popcorn Web Language Server
---
One Go language server, reached through api:cli-lsp, answers every editor feature past highlighting by reusing the parsers, the project loader, and the check catalog the CLI already runs.

```yaml
status: implemented at internal/pwlsp for the stage_2 capabilities marked below, over the project model this file describes; nothing resolves a type yet, so every stage_3 answer is still absent
stage: 2 of vision:editor-support
mechanism: decision:language-server-in-pw-cli
surface: api:cli-lsp
documents:
  kinds: the three concept:template-source-dialects suffixes, plus popcornweb.toml for requirement:editor-diagnostics
  go_sources: read for resolution, never served; gopls owns Go documents
  generated: a *_pw_gen.go is an input to navigation and never a document the server offers to change; requirement:editor-generated-peek is how its content is read, and requirement:template-source-positions is what makes a position in it resolvable
project_model:
  loaded_by: the CLI's own data:project-config reader, injected rather than reimplemented, so the server and api:cli-generate cannot disagree about which directory carries which dialect
  index: every .pw.* source the purposes list, parsed once and held as its declarations; rebuilt whole on a reload, because a purpose change adds and removes directories and reconciling that costs more than the walk
  freshness: an open buffer supersedes its indexed copy, so a declaration added and not yet saved is findable and an indexed position is never handed out stale
  type_graph:
    what: every declaration with its parameters, output, fields, and the package it belongs to, plus each file's imports, so a name resolves across files and across packages
    built_from: the parse, because these dialects declare their types; resolving a name is a lookup rather than an inference
    lowered_go: taken from system:tinybind's own Signatures where the module analyzes cleanly, never derived here; a buffer mid-edit usually does not analyze, and losing the Go type costs a line of hover rather than the answer
    visibility: a file sees its own package's declarations and the exported declarations of each package it imports; a local declaration shadows an imported one, as generation resolves it
    overlay: the open buffers replace their indexed files per request rather than mutating the index, so a closed buffer's declarations do not outlive it
    limit: the identifier under the caret is resolved, not the body position it was written in, so a name inside a string literal resolves as a reference; deciding that needs the body AST rather than the graph
    scope_layer: a second walk over the body AST collects the val bindings, loop variables, and await bindings in a declaration, which is what an inlay hint annotates and what an expression completion offers; a binding's type is filled only where its expression is a call of a declaration the graph knows, and left empty otherwise
    completion_position: decided from the text around the caret rather than from the body AST, because a buffer mid-keystroke usually does not parse and a completion that only works on a parseable document never appears
    not_covered: the Go directions of requirement:editor-navigation, which need generated output and the call sites gopls indexes
  root: the nearest popcornweb.toml, per data:project-config
  purposes: decision:explicit-generation-sources decides which directory contributes which source kind, so the server answers the same scope api:cli-generate reads
  no_project: parse-only mode, announced once over window/logMessage; syntax diagnostics still work and every resolved feature reports unavailable rather than guessing
  unreadable: a diagnostic on the popcornweb.toml that would not load, cleared by the next load that succeeds, with syntax analysis unaffected
  outside_every_purpose: a source no purpose lists is absent from the index and from workspace/symbol whether or not it is open, and still gets syntax diagnostics; it is not reported as misplaced, because decision:shared-check-catalog has no such check for api:cli-generate to have produced first
  reload: a popcornweb.toml change reloads the project model without restarting the process, over workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles; the client owns the watch, so the server registers none and every open document is republished after
capabilities:
  stage_2:
    - textDocument/publishDiagnostics, per requirement:editor-diagnostics; implemented for the syntax source
    - textDocument/documentSymbol, listing declarations of the open file; implemented
    - workspace/symbol, per requirement:editor-workspace-symbols; implemented
    - textDocument/semanticTokens, refining rule:template-grammar-scopes rather than replacing it
    - textDocument/foldingRange and textDocument/selectionRange, over declaration bodies and control forms, which the grammar cannot nest reliably across an embedded body
  stage_3:
    - textDocument/definition, references, and hover, per requirement:editor-navigation; implemented for the template-to-template half over the type graph below
    - textDocument/completion, per requirement:editor-completion; implemented
    - textDocument/inlayHint, per requirement:editor-inlay-hints; implemented
  own_methods:
    why: three surfaces stage 3 asks for have no LSP method, and inventing a use for one that exists would make a client that knows LSP guess wrong
    namespaced: pw/, so a client cannot mistake one for a standard capability and a client that does not know them never sends one
    pw/generatedFor: the emitted Go of the declaration at a position, per requirement:editor-generated-peek
    pw/routes: the concept:page-tree routes, per requirement:editor-route-explorer
    pw/storyFor: the requirement:template-storybook URL of a component, per requirement:editor-story-preview
    pw/project: the loaded project's root, name, and console URL, so a client builds a URL without reading data:project-config itself
  stage_4:
    - textDocument/rename, delegated to requirement:declaration-rename rather than implemented here, because the edit set reaches handwritten Go and sometimes a route
    - textDocument/codeAction, per requirement:editor-code-actions
  deferred:
    - formatting over LSP, because requirement:editor-formatting already delivers it through decision:formatter-delivery and a third path would be a third answer to the same question
performance:
  budget: a keystroke reparse of one document stays interactive; a whole-project analysis runs on save and on project load
  incremental: parse the open document only; resolution reuses the cached project model
  no_generation: the server never writes generated output, per policy:editor-tool-execution
transport:
  framing: the LSP base protocol, written in the server rather than taken from a library, because the pw binary carries it and a protocol package would bring a type set far wider than the capabilities above
  sync: full documents, since the parsers take a whole buffer and an incremental path would add a patch to reconcile for nothing
  reach: the buffers the client sends and nothing else; a request about a document that was never opened is refused rather than answered from disk, which is what keeps policy:editor-tool-execution's read-only promise checkable
lifecycle:
  start: on the first document of a registered language in a trusted workspace
  stop: with the window, or on an explicit restart command
  crash: the client restarts a bounded number of times and then falls back to stage-1 behavior with a single notification
acceptance:
  - a syntax error in an open document is reported without saving
  - a file opened outside any project still reports syntax diagnostics and reports no project-scoped diagnostic
  - a popcornweb.toml edit changing a generate purpose changes which files report the out-of-purpose diagnostic, with no restart
  - the server writes no file in the workspace during an editing session
  - semantic tokens and grammar scopes never disagree on the same range
```
