title: Action Invocation Runtime
---
The runtime turns a gesture on an element carrying a lowered server action into the POST that endpoint expects and applies what comes back, so `server-action` is a working mutation rather than an address the application still has to call itself.

```yaml
source: the client_runtime gap api:page-action-endpoint records, and the open question requirement:action-response-update leaves about who issues the fetch
verified_2026_08_11:
  the_address_ships: internal/pagesfixture/pages/users/id_/page_pw_gen.go lowers server-action to data-pw-action carrying /_action/00369cf962b6/Rename, and routes_pw_gen.go registers it
  nothing_invokes_it: pwbrowser/update.js and pwbrowser/boundary.js contain no occurrence of the attribute; interception covers a[href] clicks and GET submits only
  the_docs_already_say_so: the interactivity overview tells authors that intercepting the click is still theirs, so this is a stated gap rather than a discovered one
  what_exists_to_build_on: apply and updateHeaders on api:client-update-api, which consume an action response and carry the token; what is missing is the half that issues one
closed_upstream_2026_08_12:
  version: system:tinybind v0.5.8
  the_form_failure_below_is_fixed_by_the_method_alone: the emitted form now declares method=post, so neither the browser nor this runtime's GET-form interception treats it as a search form, and that happens before any interception is written here
  what_this_requirement_still_owns: issuing the request from a gesture and applying what comes back, which no lowering can supply
  interception_key_changes: the submit path keys on a GET form today and must key on the presence of the action attribute instead, or it will not see the form at all
  where_to_post: a form to its own action, which resolves to the document URL and carries the selector; a bare element to the attribute's direct endpoint, since the page POST is registered only for a handler a form names and answers 405 otherwise
  redirect_following: the page POST answers 303 when the handler wrote nothing and fetch follows it, so a caller wanting regions uses the direct endpoint or has the handler write its own response
  adoption: requirement:client-behaviour-adoption
the_form_case_is_worse_than_missing:
  fact: the scripted lowering system:tinybind applies writes no action and no method, and form.method reflects get for a form declaring none
  consequence: the submit interceptor at update.js takes it, reads get, builds a query string from the fields and navigates the page
  effect: a form carrying server-action performs a GET on the current URL, the mutation never runs, and the submitted fields land in the address bar and in history
  with_scripting_off: the same GET happens natively, so neither path reaches the handler
  no_application_workaround: system:tinybind makes an author-written action on such a form a generation error, and the hash is not a value an author can compute, so nothing an application writes closes this
  therefore: this requirement is a correctness fix on a shipped attribute, not only an ergonomic addition
gestures:
  click: an element carrying the attribute, activated by pointer or keyboard, which is what makes a bare button work
  submit: a form carrying the attribute, whatever its controls
  submit_button: a button carrying its own action inside a form, which selects that handler and sends the form's fields
  left_to_the_browser: a modified click, a target, and a download, matching the rule api:client-update-api already applies to links
  ordering: the action check runs before the navigation interception, so an element that is both a link and an action is a mutation rather than a navigation
discovery:
  how: a listener bound to the element during the same walk requirement:component-script-event-binding performs, rather than a document-level delegation
  why: rule:template-behavior-attributes settles it; one mechanism serves both sides, and the walk the client half cannot avoid makes this half free
  which_event: read from the emitted markup, which generation decided from the element kind, so the runtime infers nothing
  a_client_handler_on_the_same_element: awaited first and then the action is issued, with no channel for it to refuse by; rule:template-behavior-attributes settles why gating belongs to the actions namespace instead
request:
  method: POST, always, since the endpoint is registered for POST alone
  from_a_form: the form's fields, plus the submitter's own name and value, which FormData omits because which button was pressed is not a property of the form
  from_a_bare_element: an empty body; nothing in the markup says what else to send, and assembling a payload from data attributes would be an addressing mechanism this framework does not publish
  encoding: urlencoded or multipart as the form declares, since api:request-binding accepts both and the Go handler is unchanged either way
  headers: the action mode header of requirement:action-response-update, plus the token, so one request both mutates and asks for regions
  credentials: same-origin, unchanged
path_parameters_are_the_open_hole:
  fact: the direct entry point is /_action/<hash>/<Name> and holds no path parameter, which is what lets the lowering write it as a compile-time constant
  consequence: a handler serving a page at /users/{id} cannot read the id, because the request it receives was never addressed to that page
  observed: the fixture handler reads only its own typed body and never asks which user, which is what made the hole invisible
  contrast: the scriptless form of requirement:scriptless-action-forms posts to the page's own pattern, so api:request-binding reads the path parameters as usual
  candidates:
    hidden_fields: generation emits the page's path parameters as fields, which works for a form and not for a bare button
    page_url_header: the runtime sends the current page URL and the handler reads parameters from it, which makes the value caller-supplied and therefore untrusted input
    address_the_page: the runtime posts to the page URL with the handler named in a header or query, which is the scriptless shape with a different channel
  decided_in: decision:action-entry-point-selection, because the answer decides whether one entry point can serve both paths
  until_then: a handler needing an instance reads it from its own bound request, so an author writing a bare button supplies the id as a field the runtime cannot collect; this is a real limit and belongs in the documentation rather than in a diagnostic
response:
  update: the regions requirement:action-response-update carries, applied through the same path a delta and a redraw use, so client state preservation is not a second implementation
  navigate: the directive that replaces the region list when the action changed where the user belongs
  status: applied whatever the status says, because a 4xx carrying validation errors is the case this exists for
  not_an_update: a response with no action mode is not applied; a redirect is followed as a navigation and anything else is reported and left alone, since guessing would mean applying an ordinary JSON body as markup
  scoped_scripts: a rewritten region releases and remounts the component scripts inside it through the shared swap, unchanged from requirement:client-signal-registry
failure_deviates_from_the_navigation_rule:
  the_general_rule: requirement:unified-update-runtime falls back by performing the ordinary browser navigation to the same URL
  why_it_does_not_apply: a navigation is a GET, so redoing a failed mutation that way either loses it or repeats a POST the user never re-authorized
  form: let the native submit proceed, which reaches the handler through requirement:scriptless-action-forms and is the honest fallback because the markup already expresses it
  bare_element: no fallback exists, since nothing in the markup performs the action without script; the failure is reported through the lifecycle names of requirement:client-signal-registry and the gesture is lost
  consequence: a mutation that must survive a runtime failure belongs on a form, which is the same portability advice rule:server-action-authoring gives for scripting being off
  network_failure: distinguished from a refused request, because a 403 is an answer and a dropped connection is not
concurrency:
  in_flight: the element is marked busy for the duration, so a second activation of the same element is ignored rather than queued
  why_not_supersession: a redraw is idempotent and a mutation is not, so aborting the first and issuing a second would perform the action twice with one of the answers discarded
  contrast: api:client-update-api supersedes an older in-flight redraw for the same id, and this is the case where that rule inverts
  marker: the busy attribute requirement:update-navigation-continuity already maintains, so an application styles a pending action with what it already has
security:
  csrf: policy:csrf-protection through the header transport, read from the cookie at issue time per requirement:module-native-csrf, so a rotation reaches an open page
  origin: same-origin only, and the URL comes from generation rather than from page content
  authorization: unchanged; api:page-action-endpoint grants nothing, so the handler still authenticates and authorizes its own caller
  no_payload_assembly_from_markup: the runtime sends the form's fields or nothing, so no attribute an injected node could carry decides what is sent
rejected_client_named_target:
  shape: an attribute on the element naming the region the response rewrites, in the manner of a swap library
  why_not: requirement:action-response-update has the handler choose the regions in Go after the mutation succeeded, so the target is server state; naming it in markup would put an addressing decision in the one place an attacker-influenced node could reach
  observed: the fixture writes data-target="#name", which nothing reads and which this decision keeps that way
  what_an_author_does_instead: the handler writes the regions it changed, which is also what makes one action able to refresh several
acceptance:
  - a bare button carrying server-action performs the mutation and applies what the handler returned
  - a form carrying server-action posts its fields to the handler and never turns into a GET on the current URL
  - a submit button carrying its own action inside a form selects that handler and sends the form's fields
  - a 4xx carrying validation regions is applied, and typed text outside the rewritten region survives
  - an action response that is not an update is not applied as markup
  - a second activation of a busy element performs no second mutation
  - a failed action on a form falls back to the native submit and a failed action on a bare element is reported rather than silently dropped
  - a request carries the token from the cookie and is refused after a rotation the page did not see
  - a page with the runtime disabled is unchanged, since nothing here is a render-time emission
calling_an_action_without_a_gesture:
  asked: 2026-08-11, from React server components, where a server action is an ordinary async function client code calls
  closes: the client stub system:tinybind left open, from the caller's side
  shape: a namespace in the bag decision:component-handler-namespace hands setup, holding one async function per action of the route, so a block writes actions.Rename(input) and names no URL
  why_the_bag_and_not_an_import:
    the_rsc_shape_is_an_import: client code imports the server function, which the JavaScript toolchain then resolves and checks
    blocked_upstream: the script block of system:tinybind v0.5.5 makes a relative import specifier a generation error, because an extracted block is served from the public URL base rather than from the template's directory
    consequence: an import cannot name a module generated beside the template, so the capability has to arrive as a value; the bag is where the instance's other capabilities already arrive
  why_nested_under_one_key: the bag also carries the element and the teardown, and flattening action names into it would let a handler named el or teardown collide with a framework capability
  what_a_call_does:
    request: the same POST requirement:action-invocation-runtime issues for a gesture, with the caller's argument as the body, since api:request-binding already accepts JSON for the same input struct
    address: the page URL, per decision:action-entry-point-selection, so the path parameters a gesture can send are the ones a call sends
    an_update_response: applied exactly as a gesture's is, and the call resolves with the outcome
    a_json_response: resolved as the parsed value, which is the shape that makes this read like RSC
    a_redirect: followed as a navigation, since the handler decided where the user belongs
    in_flight_state: the caller's, because no element was activated and the runtime has nothing to mark
  which_actions_are_in_it:
    rule: the route package's, since api:page-action-endpoint publishes exactly that package's exported handler-shaped functions
    consequence: a component declared in a shared package has no route and therefore an empty namespace, which is correct and has to be documented rather than discovered
    the_scope_axis_differs_from_the_lifecycle_one: a script block is per component and an action set is per route, so a reusable component cannot reach one
  checking:
    cheap_half: the namespace is generated per route, so only actions that exist are in it and a typo is undefined at the call site rather than a request to a wrong address
    diagnostic: the runtime reports the name and what the route does publish, which is what turns undefined is not a function into an answer
    build_time_half: reading actions.Rename means parsing member expressions, which is deeper than the declarations decision:component-handler-namespace already asks for; worth having and not worth blocking on
  grants_nothing_new: every action is a public POST endpoint already, per rule:server-action-authoring, so a stub removes a URL an author would otherwise hand-write and moves no authorization boundary
  as_built_2026_08_12:
    the_join_nothing_else_held: the generated registry declares which directory a route serves and which directory a handler was declared in, and joining them is what turns a name into an address; a derived init publishes the join per route pattern, the way the reloadable registration is derived
    keyed_on_the_matched_pattern: the render reads http.Request.Pattern, so nothing re-resolves a path the router already resolved and a page with no actions costs one map lookup
    carried_as_its_own_meta: an inert escaped element beside the runtime configuration rather than a field in it, because that value is the module's struct and is process-static where this one varies per route
    returns_what_the_handler_wrote: an update response is applied as a gesture's is, and anything else is handed back, since the caller asked for it and has somewhere to put it
    the_handler_can_tell_the_two_apart:
      asked_for: 2026-08-13, so a form-invoked action and a script-invoked one may answer differently
      what_was_already_true: a script call already received JSON, because a response that is not an update mode is returned to the caller; what was missing was the Go side, where one handler served both callers and had to pick one behaviour
      channel: a second header of this framework's own, sent by a call and by nothing else
      not_a_second_mode: the mode still says action, so an update response applies to a call exactly as it does to a gesture; what this adds is who is holding the answer
      not_the_mode_parameter: system:tinybind documents the field after the semicolon as the caller's wire version, and a second meaning there would collide the day a caller versions its wire
      surface: pw.WantsValue beside pw.WantsUpdate, so an action handler has three branches and a handler asking neither is unchanged
      the_guards_ran_again: the call-pattern test refused the predicate until a pattern was registered and a pwfast counterpart existed, which is the third time that pair has caught an addition in this feature
      found_by_the_fixture: making Rename branch produced a redirect reading r.URL, which the transport analysis refuses; the direct endpoint carries no path parameter, so a handler there cannot reconstruct the page it came from and a fixed destination is the honest one
    no_in_flight_marking: no element was activated, so the state belongs to the caller that started the call
    proved: four harness cases over the request, the JSON body, the argument-free call, and the cross-origin refusal, plus the head contribution and the generated join in Go
open_questions:
  - whether an action may ask for a navigation-style diff instead of naming regions, which requirement:action-response-update also leaves open
```
