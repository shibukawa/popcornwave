title: TinyGo OpenID Connect Client

contrib/oidc implements an OpenID Connect Relying Party over requirement:contrib-oauth using requirement:contrib-jwt.

```yaml
package: contrib/oidc
scope: relying party only
public_api:
  - Discover(context, issuer, options) returns Provider
  - Client.BeginAuthorization(context, options) returns URL and transaction key
  - Client.HandleCallback(context, transaction key, callback values) returns TokenSet
  - Client.VerifyIDToken(context, raw) returns IDToken
  - Client.UserInfo(context, accessToken) optional
  - Client.UserInfoWithSubject(context, accessToken, expectedSubject) optional
  - Provider.EndSessionEndpoint() reports the discovered RP-initiated logout endpoint
  - Client.EndSessionURL(options) builds a logout request, or an empty string when the provider advertises none
  - Provider.DeviceAuthorizationEndpoint() reports the validated discovered endpoint
  - NewDeviceClient(provider, config, options) returns the requirement:oidc-device-authorization client
  - DeviceClient.Begin(context, options) returns data:device-authorization with openid scope
  - DeviceClient.Poll(context, authorization) returns TokenSet and verified IDToken
flows:
  - flow:oidc-auth-code
  - flow:oidc-device-authorization
required:
  - discovery metadata validation
  - caller-configurable endpoint host/IP trust policy
  - endpoint trust policy applies to authorization, token, JWKS, and UserInfo metadata endpoints
  - endpoint validator errors are normalized without exposing caller error strings
  - endpoint validators receive a copy and cannot rewrite the URL used for requests
  - JWKS retrieval, cache expiry, and one refresh on unknown kid
  - concurrent refresh attempts are serialized to bound network amplification
  - requirement:contrib-oauth Authorization Code and S256 PKCE behavior
  - nonce transaction binding is validated before OAuth token exchange and again against the ID Token
  - issuer, audience, azp, exp, iat, nonce, and signature validation
  - a present `azp` claim must be a non-empty string matching the client ID
  - ID Token parser size options have hard upper bounds at client construction
  - UserInfo responses require a non-empty sub claim and support subject binding
  - bearer access tokens reject control and whitespace bytes before header use
  - token exchange accepts only the Bearer token type used by the OIDC UserInfo flow
  - exact redirect URI supplied by application
  - end_session_endpoint is validated like every other discovered endpoint
  - device_authorization_endpoint is optional discovery metadata and is validated like every other discovered endpoint
  - the device client refuses construction when discovery advertises no device authorization endpoint
  - device completion verifies the ID Token without requiring a nonce; no other verification entry point gains that exemption
  - id_token_hint, post_logout_redirect_uri, and state are bounded and rejected when malformed
assurance:
  status: implemented
  needed_by: requirement:session-assurance-levels through policy:reauthentication
  surface:
    - BeginOptions.MaxAge is a pointer, so a zero duration is a request for authentication now rather than an unset field
    - BeginOptions.Prompt accepts the prompt_values of policy:reauthentication, refuses an unlisted or duplicated value, and refuses none beside another
    - setting max_age or prompt through the untyped Params map is refused, because that path carries no verification obligation this package can see
    - IDToken.AuthTime is the verified auth_time, and IDToken.ACR the verified acr
    - CallbackOptions.RequireAuthTime rejects a token that omits auth_time, which a caller sets whenever it set MaxAge
  layering:
    verified_here: that auth_time is present when required, is a JSON number, is non-negative, and is not in the future beyond the configured leeway
    left_to_caller: comparing auth_time against a freshness requirement, because recent enough is policy and carries the zero_semantics of api:assurance-guard, which a timestamp comparison cannot express
  hardening:
    quoted_number: encoding/json decodes a quoted "1700000000" into a json.Number, so the JSON type is checked on the raw bytes before parsing
    future_auth_time: refused, because accepting a provider clock ahead of ours would satisfy any freshness requirement trivially
    non_string_acr: refused rather than read as absent
  callback_signature:
    changed: HandleCallback returns the verified IDToken and takes CallbackOptions
    reason: it verified the token and discarded the result, so a caller needing a claim re-verified through VerifyIDToken, the entry point whose own documentation warns against use outside HandleCallback
    effect: plugin/auth reads the already-verified claims and no longer verifies the same token twice
deferred:
  - OpenID Provider implementation beyond the development-only requirement:contrib-devidp
  - public clients outside the typed device authorization surface
  - dynamic client registration
  - implicit and hybrid flows
  - JWE ID Tokens
  - private_key_jwt
