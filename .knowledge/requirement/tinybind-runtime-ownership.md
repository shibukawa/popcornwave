title: TinyBind Runtime Ownership Seams
---
system:tinybind htmlupdate handed the browser asset and every name on the wire to the caller in v0.3.1, so this framework composes one runtime under its own names instead of vendoring an embedded file it could not read; this records the ten findings raised against v0.3.0 and what each one became.

```yaml
owner: system:tinybind
raised_against: v0.3.0
raised_by: decision:update-runtime-convergence, while merging the two runtimes this framework now has
not_blocked: every item below had a workaround; each one cost a copy, a wrapper, or a name this framework could not choose
status: answered in full by v0.3.1, every item accepted and shipped; kept as the record of what was asked and what arrived
correction_to_this_report:
  claimed: the module reversed a boundary it had stated in three places
  actual: an unretired deviation, not a reversal; the module's own rollout requirement had already recorded that it would embed and serve the runtime until static asset extraction and runtime bootstrap existed, and no exit was scheduled
  effect_was_the_same: an interim shape reached a tagged release with no exit date and read downstream as policy, which is how this framework read it
  worth_keeping: the argument landed because the effect was real, but the intent attributed here was wrong, and a report is more useful when its wrong half is visible
  still_open_upstream: the default still serves an asset; it is fully retired only when the module's runtime bootstrap selects and injects one
as_built:
  runtime_ownership: RuntimeSource returns the bytes, RuntimeAsset returns them with a digest, media type, and file name, RuntimeConfig returns the naming, and CallerOwnsRuntime stops the module serving or referencing anything
  more_than_asked: the configuration is an exported struct the server and the browser both build, so the two cannot disagree about a name; the ask had been only for readable bytes
  protocol_names: the runtime became a factory taking a configuration carrying the attribute prefix, the header namespace, the endpoint prefix, and the installed name; only the protocol version stays compiled in
  transport_of_the_config: one JSON data attribute on the script tag rather than several named ones, which generalizes the pattern that was already right
  global_namespace: the installed name is configuration, and an empty one installs nothing, leaving a factory the caller instantiates
  author_facing_attributes: the preserve and ignore markers follow the same prefix, so no application template writes the dependency's name
  boundary_prefix: a render option names the placeholder element and the boundary identifiers together, closing the split where one document held both spellings
  runtime_filename: an option, with the module name as the default
  mount: takes a one-method router interface, which api:serve-mux satisfies unchanged, so Mount is callable here for the first time
  error_hook: a failure callback receiving a typed failure with a kind, a status, a message, a cause, and the component and instance identifiers
  more_than_asked_here_too: the ask was for a hook or an error return; what arrived is a kind enumeration suitable for a log attribute or a span, plus a default writer and an unwrappable cause
  registration: registration returns an error, a must-variant is kept, and an option validator reports every unusable option at once
  redraw_cache: a keyed ETag and a private, no-cache policy, so an unchanged redraw costs a 304, with the policy overridable
  bounds: the query bound and the stream media type became options, and the constants were renamed as defaults
headline:
  ask: do not embed, serve, or reference a browser runtime from the module
  reason: htmlbind already decided this and htmlupdate reverses it
  precedent:
    v0_1_20: the module removed the template, the marker, and the runtime script, and the framework-owner guide states that the module writes no script on any path and that each framework ships its own browser runtime
    v0_3_0: htmlupdate embeds runtime.js, serves it, versions it, and emits the script tag that loads it
    upstream_own_words: the module's own bootstrap requirement already says each framework ships its own browser runtime and the generator does not synthesize update logic per project
  consequence_if_kept: two runtimes exist for one document, and the framework's only merge path is to copy bytes out of a dependency it cannot read
findings:
  runtime_unreachable:
    where: htmlupdate/runtime.go, //go:embed runtime.js into an unexported package variable
    exported: the version, the path, the handler, and the script tag; never the source
    effect: a framework cannot compose, wrap, or extend the runtime, only mount it whole at the module's own URL under the module's own names
    workaround: vendor a copy of runtime.js
    cost: a vendored copy is not a version-pinned dependency, so upstream can change it and nothing fails; for a browser runtime that is the worst failure shape
    ask: export the source, or an assembly entry taking the naming choices and returning the bytes; better, make shipping the asset opt-in so the module's default is to ship none
  protocol_names_hardcoded_in_js:
    where: runtime.js declares the render, manifest, and build header names and the boundary id attribute as literals
    already_right: the endpoint prefix and the build identity are read from the script tag dataset, which is exactly the pattern the rest should follow
    stated_rationale: the runtime is shipped per framework, so a deployment overriding a name uses a runtime built for it
    why_that_does_not_hold: the module ships the runtime, so nobody is building one; the rationale describes a world where the headline ask is already granted
    ask: read every name from the same script tag dataset, or take one generated configuration object, so the Options header prefix is honoured end to end
  global_namespace:
    where: runtime.js installs window.tinybind and hangs update, navigate, redraw, subscribe, live, apply, updateHeaders, and two constants on it
    effect: an application on this framework calls a dependency's name, and the framework can only alias it
    ask: export a module or a factory the caller installs under its own name
  author_facing_attribute_names:
    where: runtime.js reads data-tinybind-preserve and data-tinybind-ignore
    why_worse_than_the_rest: these are written by application authors in their own templates, so the dependency's brand reaches the one surface a framework most needs to own
    not_covered: the generator data attribute prefix option does not reach them
    ask: derive them from the same prefix as everything else
  prefix_reaches_half_the_naming:
    configurable: the generated instance attribute, emitted as data-<prefix>-id
    not_configurable: the async placeholder element written as tb-boundary, and the boundary id prefix defaulting to tb
    effect: a project setting the prefix gets data-pw-id on boundaries and tb-boundary placeholders holding tb-1 ids in the same document
    ask: one prefix option covering the generated attributes, the placeholder element, and the id allocation
  runtime_filename:
    where: the runtime path is assembled as tinybind.<digest>.js
    ask: falls away with the headline ask; otherwise let the caller name the file
  mount_takes_a_concrete_mux:
    where: Mount takes *http.ServeMux
    effect: unusable here, because api:serve-mux is the system:tinygodriver httpmux type rather than the standard one
    not_blocking: RedrawHandler returns an http.Handler, so the framework registers it itself
    precedent_in_the_same_module: routetree already takes the mux type as a configurable symbol, which is the seam decision:page-render-binding uses
    ask: a one-method router interface, matching what routetree already accepts
  errors_bypass_the_caller:
    where: the redraw handler writes stale page, redraw arguments too large, invalid redraw arguments, and render failed as plain text through http.Error
    effect: a framework with RFC 9457 problem responses, HTML error pages, and request-scoped logging gets none of them on this path, and the failure never reaches api:error-renderer or the observability of requirement:modern-observability
    contrast: htmlbind sets no status and writes no header, which is the boundary that makes it composable
    ask: an error hook on Options, or a handler shape returning an error so the caller writes the response
  panics_for_operational_conditions:
    where: Register panics on a missing or repeated kind, and the build identity derivation panics
    effect: registration is called from generated registry code during startup, where this framework runs startup validation and reports a diagnostic instead of aborting the process
    agreed: failing at startup is right; a panic is not the only way to fail at startup
    ask: return an error
  response_policy_is_fixed:
    where: content type, cache control, and the echoed mode header are set by the module on every update path
    mostly_right: no-store on a delta and immutable on the asset are the correct defaults
    but: the module's own redraw requirement wants an ETag and a 304 for an unchanged redraw, which its own no-store forbids
    ask: let the caller supply the cache policy for the redraw response, since it is the one that could be conditional
  inconsistent_bounds:
    configurable: the manifest size cap, as an Options field
    fixed: the redraw query size cap and the stream content type, as package constants
    ask: same treatment for all three
what_this_framework_does_now:
  runtime: composes the exported bytes into its own asset, per requirement:unified-update-runtime; no copy, so no drift
  names: every name comes from api:html-update-options and reaches the browser as one configuration, so nothing is rebuilt for a rename
  mount: calls Mount, since the router interface matches api:serve-mux
  errors: routes every redraw failure into api:error-renderer and the request-scoped logger
priority_as_asked:
  first: the headline ask, because every naming item below it becomes mechanical once the runtime is the caller's
  second: the error hook, the only item that lost information rather than costing a copy
  third: the naming items
  fourth: the mux interface and the bounds
priority_as_delivered: all seven in one release, which removed the sequencing question rather than answering it
non_asks:
  - the delta protocol, the validators, the manifest encoding, or the operation kinds, which are the module's to define and are the reason to adopt it
  - the mode negotiation rules, which are correct and are what makes a live token share the header here
  - bundling, minification, or any JavaScript toolchain
acceptance:
  - a framework supplies its own browser runtime and the module serves none
  - a deployment renaming the headers needs no rebuilt runtime
  - an application template writes no attribute carrying the dependency's name
  - one prefix option makes every generated and rendered name agree
  - a redraw failure reaches the caller's error renderer and its logs
  - a duplicate registration is an error a startup diagnostic can report
  - a project using none of these seams sees byte-identical output, per the module's own integration-seam rule
```
