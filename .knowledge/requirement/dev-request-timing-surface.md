id: requirement:dev-request-timing-surface
type: requirement
title: Per-Request Timing In The Browser
---
A response carries a Server-Timing header naming what the request spent before its first byte and the trace that holds the rest, so a developer reading a slow page in DevTools sees the breakdown without leaving the page and can reach requirement:dev-telemetry-viewer by following an id rather than by guessing which trace was theirs.

```yaml
status: requirements recorded 2026-08-10, unimplemented
priority: should
source: user request 2026-08-10, reshaped by decision:server-timing-transport
transport: decision:server-timing-transport, which decided a header over a trailer and left the framing alone
the_gap_this_closes:
  already_true: data:framework-span-set measures every phase named below, flow:dev-telemetry-capture delivers it, and requirement:dev-telemetry-viewer displays it as a span tree
  still_missing: correlation. A developer looking at a page has no way to say which of the traces in that pane is the request in front of them, and the pane has no way to be opened at it
  therefore: the value here is one id on the wire, and the metrics are what that id can usefully travel with
  not_a_second_measurement: every value is read from the spans the tracer already opened; nothing here starts a timer of its own
source_of_values:
  reads: data:framework-span-set, through the request root span and its children
  depends_on: data:observability-runtime-config trace.enabled being on, which in api:cli-dev is already true because requirement:dev-telemetry-viewer injects an endpoint and auto follows it
  trace_off: emit nothing, rather than opening a second measurement path to fill a header. A run that measures nothing reports nothing
  why_that_rule: policy:dev-console-boundary already routes runtime facts through telemetry, and a header with its own stopwatch would be a second reader of the same question, disagreeing with the pane whenever they drifted
metrics:
  form: the Server-Timing grammar, name;dur=;desc=
  set:
    bind: request binding
    auth: authentication, present only when the request was authenticated
    db: statement time accumulated before commit, with the statement count in desc
    render: chain assembly through commit
    mode: no duration; desc carries pw.render.mode from data:framework-span-set, so the branch decision:automatic-async-render-selection took is visible beside the timing it explains
    trace: no duration; desc carries the trace id
  buffered_branch: render covers the whole document, so the header is nearly the complete account
  streaming_branch: render covers the initial build only, which is the time to first byte and the one interval no other tool on the machine separates
  absent_rather_than_zero: a phase that did not run has no metric, so a reader is never told that authentication took no time when it did not happen
correlation:
  key: the trace id, which pw.TraceID already exposes from the request context
  reaches: requirement:dev-telemetry-viewer, which holds the boundary settle spans, the live deliveries, and every statement, including those after commit
  from_a_page: PerformanceServerTiming makes the id readable from script, so the pwdev module of decision:dev-browser-runtime-scope may offer the developer a link into the pane without the framework serving a route for it
  why_that_module: it already exists, it is already dynamically imported by the requirement:framework-script-assets core, and the console URL is already injected into the application process for requirement:dev-error-overlay, so the address is in hand
  bounded: linking only. Nothing here makes the module fetch, render, or overlay timing, which would be the request profiler requirement:dev-console lists among its non-goals
gate:
  default: on in development, off in every other environment
  form: a key under data:observability-runtime-config beside trace, because the values are read from the spans that binding already configures
  not_a_build_tag:
    why: requirement:deployed-debug-information names a shared test class that is deployed and deliberately debuggable, and a build constraint would put this out of reach of exactly that class
    contrast: policy:dev-console-boundary admits only pwdev into the application, and this respects that by adding no route and no development-only code path; it changes a header on a response the application already writes
  disclosure:
    what: the header states internal phase durations to anyone who can request the page
    bound: the default answers it, since a development listener has no reader but the developer
    deliberate_elsewhere: an operator turning it on for a shared test deployment is making the same trade requirement:deployed-debug-information records for source maps, and states it in a file rather than in whoever ran the pipeline
  never_carries: a route parameter, a bind value, a user value, or anything policy:query-log-safety keeps off a span; the metric set is closed and matches the safe_dimensions of requirement:modern-observability
acceptance:
  - a buffered page served by pw dev shows bind, render, mode, and trace in the DevTools timings tab
  - a streamed page shows the same metrics, with render ending at commit rather than at the last boundary
  - the trace id in the header names a trace present in the telemetry pane for that same request
  - a page with statements before commit reports db with a count, and a page with none reports no db metric
  - performance.getEntriesByType returns the metrics as PerformanceServerTiming on http://localhost, without TLS
  - trace.enabled off emits no header and starts no timer
  - a non-development environment emits no header unless the key is set
  - the api:pwfast-package half emits the same metric names for the same request, since it commits after a successful buffered render and knows every value by then
  - no response declares a Trailer header, and no branch changes its framing
non_goals:
  - a trailer, in any form, for the reasons decision:server-timing-transport verified
  - forcing chunked encoding, in development or anywhere else
  - post-commit metrics on the wire; the trace id is how those are reached
  - a request profiler pane, which requirement:dev-console already declines in favor of requirement:dev-telemetry-viewer
  - client-side timing collection or reporting to any endpoint
  - a Server-Timing surface for api:public-asset-middleware, whose responses are served from build-time representations and measure nothing at request time
open:
  metric_names: whether bind, auth, db, render read well next to a framework the developer did not write, or whether a pw prefix is worth the bytes on every response
  db_when_pooled: whether accumulated statement time should separate connections when more than one pool is configured, which data:framework-span-set already labels per span
  launcher_link: whether the deep link belongs on requirement:dev-console-launcher, which is already the affordance in the corner of the page, rather than as a second thing the module offers
```
