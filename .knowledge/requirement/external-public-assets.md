title: External Public Assets
---

A second authored tree holds what should not enter the binary, is deployed as itself rather than as a build output, and joins the embedded tree behind one unchanged URL space.

```yaml
priority: could
status: implemented 2026-08-11
as_built:
  directory: public-external, authored and committed, outside dist because nothing transforms it
  build: addExternalAssets walks it after the served tree is collected, verifies content from the leading window, writes manifest entries, and copies nothing
  manifest: AssetRepresentation.External, with Length and ETag left zero so no validator can outlive its bytes
  serving: http.ServeContent behind the manifest entry, which supplies Accept-Ranges, 206, If-Range, and Last-Modified
  manifest_less_path: the external tree is consulted before the built one, so the loop and production agree on which wins
  path_security: safeLocalPath, factored out of the local-overlay walk, so both trees refuse a symbolic link identically
  collision: a warning naming both paths, external wins, and every representation of the shadowed URL is dropped rather than half of each
  deployment:
    container: one COPY in each scaffolded Dockerfile, with public-external/.keep written by api:cli-init because a COPY of a missing path fails the image build
    serverless: copyExternalAssets places the tree at the stage root beside config.prod.toml, for both the process artifact of AWS Lambda and Azure Functions and the source bundle of Cloud Run functions and Vercel, since all four resolve it against the working directory the function runs with
    source_bundle_exclusion: copyProjectForFunction skips the tree, because it would otherwise reach the artifact twice, once in the application subtree where nothing reads it
    only_copy_site: this is the one place the tree is copied, once per deployment artifact rather than once per compile
  advisory: PW0132 over an already-compact kind above 4 MiB in the embedded tree
  decided_during_build:
    collision_severity: proposed as an error here, settled as a warning by the user; with external precedence defined the ambiguity argument for an error no longer holds
    advisory_kinds: json and csv are deliberately outside the advisory set, because they compress and the embedded tree is doing real work for them
answers: the large_media_in_an_embedded_tree question of requirement:public-asset-delivery
shape:
  source: two authored directories, one embedded and one not
  url: both mount at the same prefix, so what a page names does not say which tree answered
  build_does_to_the_second_tree: walks it, verifies content, writes manifest entries, and copies nothing
  deployment: the container scaffold copies the authored directory itself
why_it_beats_the_earlier_sketches:
  the_copy_is_the_point:
    problem_it_removes: selecting by media kind at build time means the build must separate the two out of one directory, which is a byte-for-byte copy of the largest files in the project on every build
    why_the_copy_was_pure_cost: policy:asset-transform-matrix already classifies these kinds as already_compact, whose action is "verbatim copy, no precompression", so the build output would have been identical to its input
    conclusion: dist/public exists because authored files are transformed into it; a tree nothing transforms has nothing to gain from a staging copy
  selection_needs_no_mechanism: placement decides, so there is no kind table to keep current, no override list, and no threshold whose meaning changes as a file grows
  the_url_space_is_untouched: nothing is renamed and no reference is rewritten, which is what makes this additive rather than a migration
what_it_gives_up:
  no_help_for_the_unaware: an author who does not know the second tree exists puts a video in the first one and it is compiled into the binary, where the kind table would have moved it unasked
  how_to_get_it_back_cheaply:
    form: an advisory naming a large file of an already_compact kind in the embedded tree, with the second tree as its remedy
    why_this_is_the_right_place_for_a_size_rule: a threshold that only decides whether to speak is safe, where one that decides where bytes live makes the same asset embedded in one build and external in the next
    it_already_has_a_home: the size advisory recorded under requirement:public-asset-delivery, which until now had no remedy to name
    reads_the_same_table: already_compact tells it which kinds are worth mentioning, so the kind table survives as the advisory's input rather than as the router's
rules_it_must_state:
  collision: one URL reachable from both trees is a build error, since nothing else could decide which bytes the entry means
  resolution: the manifest entry names which tree holds the bytes and the handler goes straight there, never probing one and falling back to the other
  why_resolution_is_worth_a_rule: data:public-asset-manifest exists so serving is manifest-driven rather than filesystem-driven, and the read_local layering of policy:public-asset-resolution already needed an explicit rule that a local original never falls back to an embedded sidecar, because mixing layers within one URL was a real defect
  development: decision:derived-tree-development gains a second root and nothing else, since both trees are already files on disk in the loop
  determinism: an external entry records its path, media type, and cache policy and no digest or timestamp, so policy:generated-artifacts --check still compares two builds
the_missing_requirement:
  range_requests:
    fact: api:public-asset-middleware supports none; it sets Content-Length and copies the whole body, with no Accept-Ranges and no 206 anywhere
    consequence: a video element cannot seek, and playing from the middle downloads the file from the start; a large asset that cannot be ranged is transferred rather than served
    why_it_belongs_here: if the motivating kind is video, a mechanism that keeps the bytes out of the binary and still cannot range them has not solved the case it was built for
    what_makes_it_cheap: an external file is a real file, so http.ServeContent supplies Range, If-Range, and the validator from an io.ReadSeeker with no protocol code written here
    independent_value: the same handler serves a large PDF or a download identically, so it is worth building whether or not the rest of this is
    conclusion: the external tree is its own handler rather than a flag on the existing one, because the existing one throws the ReadSeeker away
caching:
  problem: the tree is deployed as its own artifact, so a build-time strong ETag can describe bytes the deployment replaced
  why_that_is_the_specific_failure_to_avoid: data:public-asset-manifest exists so a response never claims what the build did not produce, and api:public-asset-middleware already treats a manifest naming an absent file as a 500 for exactly this reason
  recommendation: no build-time digest; http.ServeContent takes size and modification time from the file it is handed, so the validator is honest without the manifest carrying anything that could go stale
  the_thing_that_cannot_be_had: independent deployment and an immutable URL at once, since immutable is only honest for a name carrying the digest of its own bytes, per requirement:derived-asset-pipeline caching
  so: these URLs revalidate, and that is the trade the mechanism is
deployment:
  who_copies_it: the api:cli-init container scaffold, which already COPYs the binary and the production configuration explicitly and gains one more line naming a directory that needs no build stage
  narrows_to: a container or bundle deployment, which is every target of decision:serverless-target-scope
  bare_binary: a project shipping a binary by itself has no step that would carry a directory, so the build says it produced one rather than assuming something will notice
  refused_targets: requirement:cloudflare-workers-hosting has no filesystem, so a build for it fails naming the target rather than emitting an artifact that 404s in production
unchanged_by_this:
  verification: requirement:asset-content-verification reads only the leading window for anything but SVG, so checking a large file costs what checking a small one costs, and the second tree is checked like the first
  precompression: policy:public-asset-precompression already excludes audio and video, so nothing changes for the motivating kind
  transforms: nothing in the second tree is converted, which is what makes it the second tree
open_questions:
  naming: bundle already means the script build in this project, so a directory named for bundling reads as an instruction to the JavaScript pipeline rather than a statement about the binary; the distinction the name has to carry is which artifact the bytes ship in
  existing_projects: concept:project-layout scaffolds public.go once and never rewrites it, so an existing project acquires the second tree by hand, as requirement:derived-asset-pipeline already found for dist/public
  first_request_latency: an embedded read is a slice of the binary image and an external read is a file open, which is the right trade for a video and worth measuring before anything small is moved
acceptance_sketch:
  - a video in the second tree is absent from the binary, present in the image, served under its ordinary URL, and seekable
  - the embedded tree of the same project builds byte-identically to a build before this existed
  - no large file is copied by the build
  - one URL reachable from both trees fails the build naming both paths
  - a URL the manifest does not name is 404 whatever either tree holds
  - a target that cannot carry a directory fails the build naming the target, rather than at the first request
  - a page referencing an asset does not say, and cannot tell, which tree answered
non_goals:
  - uploading anything anywhere, which stays operator state per decision:serverless-target-scope
  - a media hosting story, a CDN integration, or an object storage client
  - transcoding, which policy:asset-transform-matrix already refuses at request time and this does not reopen
  - a second mount or a second configuration key for the URL space, which stays contiguous
  - moving a file between the trees automatically, which is the threshold problem this shape exists to avoid
```
