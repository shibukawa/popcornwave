title: CBOR API Representation
---
API endpoints speak application/cbor beside JSON. The mechanism shipped upstream in system:tinybind v0.5.19 as a generation-time opt-in; the pw work is declaring the switch and its profile in popcornweb.toml, passing both through api:cli-generate, and bumping the two dependencies. JSON stays the default; a project leaving the switch off regenerates today's bytes exactly and links no CBOR code.

```yaml
upstream_delivered:
  version: tinybind v0.5.19, completed by v0.5.20, over tinygodriver v1.2.7 (generated code names the driver directly)
  option: generator Options.EnableCBORHTTP plus Options.CBORHTTPProfile{RejectFloats, RequireSortedKeys}; CLI -cbor-http, -cbor-http-reject-floats, -cbor-http-sorted-keys
  granularity: project-wide on purpose — which media types a service accepts is a property of the service, not of one route; no per-route or per-type spelling
  request_side:
    - Content-Type application/cbor or any +cbor suffix (RFC 6839) binds payload fields from one CBOR map with text keys
    - unknown keys are skipped; path, query, header, cookie inputs bind unchanged beside the body
    - body cap httpbind.SetMaxCBORBodyBytes, default 1 MiB matching JSON, shared by both transport runtimes
    - a payload:"*" rest map has no CBOR mapping and is a generation error, not a silent drop
  response_side:
    - answers CBOR only when Accept explicitly names application/cbor; wildcards keep the JSON default, so a browser's */* never flips the format
    - generated writer branches to WriteCBORBytes with Content-Type application/cbor, after VaryAccept marks the response as Accept-keyed for shared caches
  profile:
    - the generator's own CBORHTTPProfile type, not the driver's Profile; hashed into the generation fingerprint so both ends of the protocol agree on every regeneration
    - zero value is the default profile: floats are ordinary values, members emit in struct field order
    - RejectFloats refuses float64 fields at generation and floats in request bodies at decode, for scaled-integer schemas
    - RequireSortedKeys emits RFC 8949 4.2.1 bytewise key order; a runtime map field cannot promise it and becomes a generation error
  fasthttp_parity: fasthttpbind carries the same helpers, so the derived transport of requirement:typed-api-method-convergence works unchanged
resolved_from_earlier_draft:
  opt_in: settled — generation-time project switch, not registration or per-type declaration
  response_trigger: settled — explicit Accept only, no symmetric default from the request body's type
  problem_documents: settled — problems stay application/problem+json in every case
  body_intermediate: settled — generated binders decode the CBOR map inline; no jsonbind.Object analogue exists
  profiles: the old wire/world presets are gone (application-side now); the HTTP subset is the two-flag CBORHTTPProfile instead
pw_integration:
  config:
    - popcornweb.toml block '[generate.api.cbor]' with enabled, reject_floats, sorted_keys; absent block means disabled, enabled alone uses the default profile
    - a project setting rather than a pw generate flag for the same reason as line_directives: api:cli-check compares against fresh generation, and output must not depend on who ran it
    - api:cli-init scaffolds the block with enabled false and a comment stating what off costs (nothing)
  generation:
    - projectConfig carries the block; the generate command maps it onto EnableCBORHTTP and CBORHTTPProfile
    - go.mod moved to tinybind v0.5.19 and tinygodriver v1.2.7
  runtime:
    - pw.WriteAPI and pw.Parse needed no signature change; negotiation lives in the generated writers and binders they dispatch to
    - compression per policy:response-content-encoding wraps the writer unchanged
    - body cap exposed as server.cbor_max_body (int64 bytes, 0 keeps the runtime's 1 MiB default); both lifecycles apply it once at startup because the value is process-wide in the binding runtime, and a negative value is a startup error
  docs: guide the switch, the two profile flags and when not to use them, per the docs house style
upstream_followups_resolved:
  in: tinybind v0.5.20, which pw now requires
  vary_header: generated writers call VaryAccept before negotiating, so a shared cache keys the entry on Accept
  openapi: the generated document advertises application/cbor request and response content when the option is on, except for a request body carrying a rest map, which the CBOR emitter refuses and the document therefore must not advertise
verification:
  - a POST with Content-Type application/cbor binds the same values as its JSON equivalent
  - a GET with Accept application/cbor returns a CBOR body equal in content to the JSON answer; Accept */* still gets JSON
  - with the toml block absent or enabled false, pw generate reproduces today's output byte for byte and the binary links no CBOR symbol
  - toggling any profile key changes the generation fingerprint, so api:cli-check reports stale generated code
```
