title: Query Navigation Interception
---
A link click, a GET form submission, and a back or forward gesture become one navigation delta request for the URL the browser would have gone to, so a search form refines the page it is on for the cost of the region that changed, and every gesture the browser should keep is still the browser's.

```yaml
source: decision:update-runtime-convergence
motivation: a search parameter is the ordinary way a page takes an argument and the default HTML form already writes one, so intercepting the submission rather than publishing an API is what makes requirement:navigation-delta-rendering reachable from markup that predates it
the_specification_is_the_browser:
  rule: for every gesture, what the browser does with this script absent is the correct answer, and a deliberate difference is stated rather than inherited from what was easiest to write
  why_it_is_the_right_test: scripting off is not a fallback path here but the absence of one, so a divergence is this feature making a page worse than not having it
  guarded_by: a Go test rendering one chain with updates on and off and comparing the markup a client renders and submits, since nothing the runtime needs may be load-bearing for a client that will never run it
as_built:
  where: the update half of requirement:unified-update-runtime, installed once at bootstrap against the document
  link: a left click with no modifier on a same-origin anchor carrying no target, no download, and no ignore marker above it
  form: a submit on a form resolving to GET, with no target and no ignore marker above it; its fields become the whole query, which is what the browser would have sent
  submitter: formaction, formmethod, and formtarget decide the method, the URL, and the target before this runtime decides whether it owns the submission at all, and the pressed button's own name and value join the query
  why_the_pair_is_added_by_hand: the FormData constructor leaves every submit button out, because which one was pressed is not a property of the form
  same_document_fragment: left to the browser entirely, since it holds the element, a round trip could only arrive at the same page, and leaving it alone is what keeps :target styling and deep-link back behavior ordinary
  history: pushed for a link and a form, replaced for a programmatic update, written by neither on a pop, and never before the response commits
  left_to_the_browser: a non-GET submission, a modified click, a target, a download, and a cross-origin URL, which is what keeps post-redirect-get working unchanged
  failure: the ordinary browser navigation, per the invariant of requirement:unified-update-runtime
programmatic_update_replaces_the_whole_query:
  what: api:client-update-api update clears the search string before setting the parameters it was given, so changing sort drops page and q
  kept_deliberately: a GET form submission replaces the whole query by specification, and the two paths answering differently is worse than either answer
  now_stated: at the call site and in the guide, which is where an author looks rather than where the source is
  open: whether a merging call joins the surface beside it, which is a question about what an author writes and not about what the wire can carry
conformance:
  covered: the URL and the query a link and a form resolve to, the submitter's three overrides, the pressed button's pair, a non-GET form, a modified click, a download, the ignore marker on an ancestor, a same-document fragment, and a cross-document one
  why_here: which URL and which method a gesture turns into is protocol rather than DOM insertion, and it is the one part of this runtime no Go assertion can reach
non_goals:
  - a client-side routing table; the server still answers every URL and a delta is an optimization of that answer
  - prefetch, which api:client-update-api carries as its own open question
  - patching one parameter of an already-rendered page, since flow:partial-refresh records why there is no such mode
acceptance:
  - a GET form submission transfers the page region and not the layout, with the address bar showing the query the browser would have written
  - a submit button overriding the method or the action reaches the destination it reaches with the runtime absent
  - a submit button carrying a name and a value contributes that pair to the query
  - an in-page fragment link issues no request and moves to its target
  - back and forward restore the page each entry described
  - enabling updates changes no byte of the markup a client that runs no script renders and submits
```
