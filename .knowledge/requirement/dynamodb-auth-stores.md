title: DynamoDB Account-Side Authentication Stores
---
authstore/dynamo implements the allowlist, credential, and bootstrap stores of plugin/auth over requirement:dynamodb-store; the fourth store, ceremony state, is requirement:contrib-auth-state-dynamo.

```yaml
package: authstore/dynamo
family: authstore, a fourth entry in rule:storage-package-layout, named by user 2026-08-01
implemented: 2026-08-05, all three stores with the account index, the conditional sign-count update, and the single-request attempt spend
why_a_new_family: these are the framework-owned account tables of plugin/auth, and they are neither a connection, a session record, nor a single-use ceremony record
why_one_package: decision:dynamodb-auth-compensating-registration orders three writes across two of these stores, so they ship and are verified together
selected_by: decision:auth-backend-selection
client:
  source: the request context, installed by the api:dynamo-package middleware
  no_constructor_argument: matching requirement:contrib-auth-state-dynamo, since system:tinybind carries the client in the context
  missing: the driver's no-client error, surfaced as the contract error of each store
tables:
  declared_names: popcornweb_auth_allowlist, popcornweb_passkey_credential, and popcornweb_auth_bootstrap, unchanged from rule:framework-owned-tables
  definitions: handwritten, not generated, for the reason requirement:dynamodb-session-store gives; this package is the only reader and writer of these items
  registration: decision:dynamodb-table-registry, from init, so requirement:dynamodb-migration creates all three
  conditional_verification: rule:framework-owned-tables applies unchanged; a table is verified only when the selected mode reads it and no application store is installed
allowlist:
  contract: api:auth-allowlist-store
  key: one partition key holding the issuer, the claim name, and the value joined; no sort key
  why_joined:
    rejected: issuer as the partition key and claim#value as the sort key
    reason: a deployment usually has one issuer, so that shape puts every login's admission read on one partition
    lost: an issuer-scoped listing, answered instead by a Scan, which is acceptable because the table is bounded by how many identities an operator registered and listing is administrative rather than per-request
  lookup: one BatchGetItem over the candidate keys; any returned item is a match
  partial_batch: the driver reports unprocessed keys, and an incomplete answer is an error rather than a non-match, per api:auth-allowlist-store
  writes: none; provisioning is administrator tooling
credential:
  contract: api:auth-credential-store CredentialStore
  key: the credential ID as the partition key; no sort key
  find: GetItem, consistent read, because a credential enrolled moments ago must be findable on the next login
  list_by_account:
    operation: Query on a global secondary index keyed by account_id
    index: declared in the handwritten TableDefinition, which system:tinygodriver-dynamodb supports at creation
    bound: no UpdateTable, so this index cannot be added to a table that already exists; a deployment that created the table before the index existed recreates it
    scope_note: the "no secondary index" bound of requirement:dynamodb-store is about the deferred system:tinybind gsi tag, and does not reach a handwritten definition
    projection: the credential ID, the transports, and the user handle
    why_the_handle: an enrollment reuses the handle the account already has, and a listing that could not see it would mint a second one for the same account
  save: PutItem conditioned on the credential ID being absent, then the activation callback, per decision:dynamodb-auth-compensating-registration
  update_on_assertion:
    operation: UpdateItem conditioned on the stored sign count being lower than the accepted one
    why_conditioned: a counter that moves backward is a replayed or cloned authenticator, and the condition makes the store refuse it rather than the caller
    failure: a conditional-check failure fails the ceremony closed and is never downgraded to a warning
  delete: DeleteItem, idempotent by construction
bootstrap:
  contract: api:auth-credential-store BootstrapStore
  key: the login ID as the partition key; no sort key
  issue: PutItem conditioned on the login ID being absent
  find: GetItem, then the unconsumed, unexpired, and attempts-remaining checks
  record_attempt:
    operation: one UpdateItem adding minus one, conditioned on attempts_remaining being positive and the record unconsumed, with ALL_NEW returned
    why_one_request: the contract requires that two parallel guesses cannot both spend the last attempt, and a read followed by a write cannot promise it
    exhausted: a conditional-check failure, reported as the contract's unknown-bootstrap error
  consume: UpdateItem conditioned on consumed_at being absent, which is step one of decision:dynamodb-auth-compensating-registration
  enumeration: an exhausted budget, a consumed credential, and an unknown login ID all return the same error, unchanged from the contract
stored_attributes:
  timestamps: epoch-second numeric attributes, since DynamoDB has no time type
  binary: credential IDs, user handles, COSE blobs, curve points, and secret digests are binary attributes
  expires_at: the bootstrap record carries one, and it is the attribute a deployment points TTL at
  expiry_authority: the stored deadline checked on read, per decision:dynamodb-session-expiry, which applies here for the same reason
  ttl_is_not_ours: nothing in the framework enables or verifies it, per decision:dynamodb-operational-configuration; the credential and allowlist tables have no expiry at all
bounds:
  item_size: a record over the DynamoDB item limit is refused before the request with the limit named, matching requirement:dynamodb-session-store
  transports_and_label: bounded before encoding, since an unbounded label is the only credential field an application controls
security:
  - no request this package issues produces a query-diagnostics record, per policy:query-log-safety
  - errors carry no credential ID, user handle, login ID, secret, or claim value, per policy:passkey-security and policy:oidc-security
  - the raw bootstrap secret is never stored or logged, per data:account-bootstrap-credential
acceptance:
  - a passkey login and a passkey enrollment onto an active account complete with no relational database configured
  - oidc.admission registered admits a pre-registered identity and denies an unregistered one, and an unprocessed batch key is an error
  - a second Issue for a live login ID fails without overwriting
  - N parallel RecordAttempt calls against a budget of one leave exactly one caller with an attempt
  - an assertion carrying a sign count at or below the stored one is refused by the store
  - a passkey-only registration interrupted after step one leaves no credential, and one interrupted after step two leaves a provisional account that cannot create a session
  - all three tables are created by the same pw migrate run that creates application tables
  - two parallel test servers with different prefixes never observe each other's credentials, per requirement:dynamodb-test-isolation
non_goals:
  - a sweep of expired bootstrap records
  - storing data:user-account or data:external-identity, which stay application-owned
  - sharing one table with requirement:contrib-auth-state-dynamo or requirement:dynamodb-session-store
  - a second index on the allowlist or the bootstrap table
