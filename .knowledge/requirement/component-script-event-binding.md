title: Component Script Event Binding
---
A template names a handler its component's script block declared, and the runtime binds it as a listener on that element, so the handler is written beside the markup that triggers it without the inline script a strict CSP forbids and the module scope makes unreachable anyway.

```yaml
source: the authored-islands tier of concept:interaction-cost-ladder, which today costs an author their own querySelector plumbing
rides_on: the per-instance lifecycle requirement:client-signal-registry already ships, so this adds a binding pass to a mount that exists rather than a lifecycle
why_an_inline_handler_cannot_be_the_answer:
  module_scope: the script block of system:tinybind v0.5.5 makes the block an ES module, so an exported function is not a global and onclick="increment()" resolves nothing
  csp: policy:security-response-headers is written so script-src can be self with no nonce, and requirement:unified-update-runtime states applying every path under no inline allowance as an acceptance condition; an event handler content attribute needs unsafe-hashes at least
  it_compiles_today: the event attribute context rule of system:tinybind leaves a static on-attribute untouched, so a template writing one generates, ships, and fails in the browser with nothing having said so
  lifetime: an attribute handler is re-parsed with the markup and belongs to no scope, so it survives none of the release requirement:client-signal-registry performs and reinstalls itself on every swap
  therefore: the feature has to be a lowering, which is the same shape server-action already has
authoring:
  writes: an attribute on the element naming a handler, with no call syntax and no arguments
  spelled: decision:event-binding-attribute-spelling
  element_it_resolves_under: the nearest enclosing component declaring a script block, which is the element carrying the marker requirement:client-signal-registry mounts against
  name_it_resolves_against: what that instance's setup returned, per decision:component-handler-namespace
  handler_shape: the function receives the event, whose currentTarget is the element the attribute was written on
  no_arguments: an argument list is an expression to evaluate at bind time, and a name reached in a namespace is not; what varies per element is read from the DOM or closed over by setup
  precedent: rule:client-event-authoring already tells an author to close over the constant and read the varying, and this is the same rule one layer down
shipped_upstream_2026_08_12:
  version: system:tinybind v0.5.8, which reserves the attribute, resolves the name against an answer this framework supplies, and lowers it
  emitted: one attribute per element listing every pair, in the comma-and-colon grammar this catalog asked for, so click:increment,blur:validate is one indexed selector away
  reservation_is_narrower_than_proposed: it applies only inside a component declaring a script block, and elsewhere an on-prefixed hyphenated attribute is emitted unread
  not_matched: a second hyphen, so on-my-event stays the ordinary custom-element attribute it was
  refused: a computed value, and two of the same event on one element
  what_is_left_here: the parser behind the seam and the runtime binding, both of which this requirement already specifies
lowering:
  emits: a data attribute carrying the event name and the handler name, replacing the authored attribute
  never_emitted: the authored attribute itself, matching how the lowering never emits server-action
  static: the value is a string literal, so the pair is a compile-time constant and folds into the surrounding static run
  untouched: every other attribute on the element survives unread, unchanged from the server-action rule
  several: one element may declare more than one event
  why_the_authored_attribute_cannot_simply_survive:
    selector: CSS has no attribute-name prefix match, so finding on-anything means walking every element and iterating its attributes, on every mount and every swap; a lowered marker is one indexed querySelectorAll, which is the call the runtime already makes for the scope marker at pwbrowser/boundary.js:600
    collision: the event attribute context rule of system:tinybind says a hyphenated on-name belongs to a custom element, so leaving it in the DOM is claiming a namespace that document explicitly assigned elsewhere
    checking_is_separable: generation could check the name and still emit it unchanged, so this is a mechanism argument rather than a checking one
  emitted_shape:
    settled: with the user 2026-08-11, one prefixed event attribute listing what the element binds, such as click,blur
    selector: one indexed querySelectorAll over that attribute finds every behaviour-bearing element of either kind, which is the constraint that ruled the authored attribute out
    grammar_already_ships: comma between entries and colon within one is what parseScopeCatalog reads at pwbrowser/boundary.js:742, so a packed pair list reuses a parse rule that is written, tested, and documented rather than inventing a second
    prefixed: the framework prefix, like every other attribute it writes and like the configurable spellings api:client-update-api publishes, so an unprefixed name cannot collide with an application's own or a third party's
binding:
  when: in the mount pass, after setup returned, since the namespace is what setup produced and does not exist before then
  how: the runtime scans the mounted subtree for the emitted attribute and adds a listener per declared pair from that instance's namespace
  what_the_runtime_already_has: boundary.js calls setup(element, scope) at pwbrowser/boundary.js:721 and keeps what it returned, so the namespace is a value in hand rather than a new channel
  what_changes_in_the_runtime: mounted stores a record rather than a teardown function, because a later swap inside an already-mounted component needs the namespace again
  a_region_swapped_later: the incoming markup is scanned for the same attribute and bound against the nearest ancestor marker's retained namespace, which is what makes a nested redraw inside a mounted component work
  window_before_mount: an element carrying the attribute is inert until its module imports and its setup returns, unchanged in kind from today, since the import was always async; a control that must not be pressed early is rendered disabled and enabled by setup
  release: none needed; a listener added directly to a node dies with the node, so nothing is recorded and nothing can leak
  unresolved_name: reported through the diagnostics channel and the element is left inert, never guessed at
a_handler_may_be_async:
  decided: with the user 2026-08-11, together with the same answer for setup
  awaited: the runtime awaits what a handler returned, so the gesture is in flight until it settles
  in_flight_state:
    re_entry: guarded by the runtime, which ignores a second activation of the same element rather than queueing it; this is the correctness half and it works on any element
    marker: the busy attribute requirement:update-navigation-continuity already maintains, so an application styles a pending gesture with what it already has
    announced: aria-disabled rather than the disabled property
    why_not_disabled: disabling the focused control moves focus to the document body, which loses the user's place and is a known regression of the pattern; aria-disabled says the same thing to assistive technology and moves nothing, and the runtime's own guard is what actually blocks the second activation
    ordering_with_a_form: the fields are collected before anything is marked, so nothing the user typed is excluded by a control that has since been marked
  rejection: reported through the diagnostics channel; the element leaves its in-flight state either way, because a handler that threw must not leave a control inert forever
rejected_delegation:
  shape: one listener per event type at the document, dispatching by the nearest matching ancestor
  buys: an element inserted at any time works with no rescan
  why_not: the module is imported dynamically, so a dispatcher may have to await it, and a handler cannot preventDefault after an await; a submit or a modified click would take its default action before the handler ran
  cost_of_the_choice: a rescan on every swap, which is a walk the apply loop is already doing for markers
  settled_for_both: rule:template-behavior-attributes takes this walk for the server side too, since the action side never needed delegation and one mechanism is worth more than the rescan it saves
checking:
  asked_for: system:tinybind resolving the name at generation, per decision:component-handler-namespace, so a typo fails the build the way a renamed server action already does
  what_it_costs_upstream: reading the block, which reverses the standing position that the module reads no JavaScript and is the one part of this that is an agreement rather than an implementation
  total_for_the_idiomatic_shape: a setup returning an object literal and a top-level function declaration are both enumerable; a namespace assembled conditionally is not, and is reported as unverified rather than passing silently
  what_generation_can_check_with_no_parser_at_all: that the element is inside a component declaring a script block, which is a generation error naming the file, line and column when it is not
  until_then: a name unresolved at mount is reported through the diagnostics channel, which stays necessary afterwards because a partial check is not a total one
  not_mitigated_by_a_convention: requiring a prefix or a naming rule would check spelling and not existence
why_this_beats_setup_doing_it_itself:
  possible_today: setup receives the element and can addEventListener on anything under it, so nothing here is newly expressible
  the_handler_is_the_same_function_either_way: decision:component-handler-namespace resolves it in setup's own closure, so this removes the wiring and changes nothing about what a handler can reach
  what_it_costs_instead: a selector per handler, written in the script and matched in the markup, which is the untyped string pairing server-action exists to remove one layer up
  loops: an element rendered inside a for block needs the author to select many and bind each, and the declarative form binds each one where it was written
  legibility: the reason a page's button does something is on the button, which is the property that makes this an ergonomics feature rather than sugar
security:
  no_dynamic_names: the handler name is a static literal from the template, so no payload and no attribute an injected node could carry decides which function runs
  the_rule_it_inherits: rule:client-event-authoring forbids publishing a general mechanism that dispatches by a string somebody else supplied, and a generation-time literal is the opposite of that
  csp_unchanged: nothing inline is emitted, so script-src stays self with no nonce and no unsafe-hashes
  cross_origin: the module URL is the server's own and already refused when it is not, unchanged from what boundary.js does today
acceptance:
  - a button naming a handler runs it on click, with no inline script and no author-written selector
  - the handler receives the event and reaches the element it was written on
  - a handler reads and writes the state its own instance's setup built, without deriving it from the event
  - twenty elements rendered in a loop each bind their own listener into their own instance's namespace
  - a region replaced by a delta, a redraw, or an action response binds the handlers in the incoming markup
  - an instance destroyed leaves no listener behind and records nothing that could
  - a name no namespace holds fails generation once the block is read, and is reported at mount until then
  - an element declaring a handler outside any component with a script block fails generation with a position
  - a strict CSP with no inline allowance runs every bound handler
  - a project declaring no handler regenerates byte-identical output
open_questions:
  - whether a handler may be declared on the component's own root element, where the marker already is, or whether that collides with the marker's own reading
  - whether an event needs modifiers such as prevent or stop, which every comparable framework grew and which each one spells differently
  - whether a page's own script reaches this, given a page is a component with a script block and the marker mechanism does not distinguish one
