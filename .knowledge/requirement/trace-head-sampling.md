title: Trace Head Sampling
---
requirement:contrib-otel decides once, at the root span, whether a trace is recorded, so a deployment pays for a fraction of its traces instead of producing every span and asking something downstream to throw them away.

```yaml
status: built 2026-08-18 in contrib/otel/trace, pwconfig, and pwobservability; every acceptance below covered by a test
priority: should
source: user request 2026-08-17, alongside requirement:framework-metrics
reverses:
  what: the contrib/otel/trace package comment, which states that it records every span and that sampling belongs at the receiving relay or collector
  why_that_was_reasonable: it kept the tracer small, and a collector genuinely is where a decision about a whole trace can be made with the trace in hand
  why_it_is_not_enough:
    cost_is_upstream: a relay discarding a span does not un-allocate it, un-encode it, or un-send it; every span still costs an attribute slice, a queue slot, a batch, and a request
    the_span_count_is_not_one_per_request: data:framework-span-set opens a render span, an initial build, one per settled boundary, one per live delivery, and one per statement, so a page that awaits three boundaries and runs six statements is a dozen spans of one request
    the_developer_loop_pays_too: requirement:dev-telemetry-viewer holds a bounded buffer, and an unsampled load test fills it with the traffic rather than with the request being investigated
    there_is_a_route_with_no_relay: the direct route of flow:telemetry-export sends to the collection backend itself, so the sentence assumed a component that deployment does not run
  kept: tail sampling is still the collector's, and this requirement does not claim it
per_route:
  relayed: a collector may still tail-sample, so a deployment that wants a complete trace set on that route sets always_on here and decides downstream
  direct: head sampling is the only stage there is, which is what makes the default below a cost decision rather than a preference
mechanism:
  seam: the trace Provider, consulted by Tracer.Start
  why_there: it is the one place that already distinguishes a root from a child, which is the only distinction a head sampler makes; the middleware would see only server spans, and the processor would see spans already built
  what_start_does_today: it sets trace flags to 1 for a root and inherits the parent's flags for a child, then records unconditionally, so a remote parent arriving with the sampled bit clear is already being ignored
  root: the sampler decides
  child: never re-decides; it inherits, which is what makes a trace whole rather than a set of spans that each rolled dice
samplers:
  set: always_on, always_off, traceidratio, parentbased_always_on, parentbased_always_off, parentbased_traceidratio
  why_that_set: it is the OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER vocabulary, so an operator configures this the way they configure any other OpenTelemetry process
  default:
    rule: decision:sampling-default-follows-the-environment — parentbased_always_on under data:runtime-environment dev, and parentbased_traceidratio at 0.1 under every other token
    not_the_sdk_default: an unconfigured deployment samples, which the OpenTelemetry SDKs do not do and which this framework does because the direct route bills per span and a request is a dozen of them
    overridden_by: any explicit trace.sampler or OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER value, after which the token is not read
    reported: policy:startup-summary names the sampler, the ratio, and default-by-environment as the provenance
  ratio_is_deterministic:
    rule: the decision is computed from the trace id and never from a random draw
    why: two services configured at one ratio must agree, or a sampled trace loses its middle
  parent_based: a valid remote parent decides, and the configured sampler applies only where there is none, which is the only rule under which an edge service's ratio governs the trace it started
unsampled_span:
  still_valid: the SpanContext is real — a trace id, a span id, and the sampled bit clear — because propagation and correlation depend on it and a downstream service must be told the decision rather than allowed to make a second one
  injects: the traceparent of decision:outbound-trace-propagation carries flags 00, so a callee running parentbased_always_on does not record what its caller declined
  correlates: api:logger still stamps trace_id and span_id, so policy:log-emission and requirement:query-diagnostics records are unaffected and an unsampled request is still traceable through its logs
  records_nothing: no attribute retained, no event, no status, and never enqueued
  drop_point: the processor at End, so nothing reaches the queue of flow:telemetry-export and its dropped-record count keeps meaning what it means
  cost_target: no attribute slice and no span data allocation, so an unsampled request approaches the cost of trace.enabled off rather than the cost of exporting
  parent_chain: Parent and Root of requirement:context-lookup-performance still answer, since the pointer chain is what makes an ancestor lookup free and a nil chain would change that API's meaning per sampling decision
configuration:
  field: a sampler key and its argument under observability.trace of data:observability-runtime-config
  environment: OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER and OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG, joining the three standard variables that binding already accepts
  reported: policy:startup-summary states the resolved sampler and ratio with its provenance, because a process recording one trace in a thousand looks identical to a broken one
  development:
    default: always_on, as the dev branch of decision:sampling-default-follows-the-environment rather than as a rule of its own
    why_it_has_to_be: requirement:dev-request-timing-surface reads its Server-Timing values from the spans the tracer opened, and requirement:dev-telemetry-viewer is the developer's only view of a request; a sampled dev loop is a loop where the page just looked at is missing
    injected_endpoint: turns trace.enabled auto on, and must not turn sampling on with it
    still_settable: a developer reproducing a sampled deployment sets the key and gets the ratio, which is the reason this is a default and not an exemption
  independent_of_metrics: decision:metrics-are-not-sampled — a ratio here changes no count of requirement:framework-metrics, which is the property that makes a low ratio survivable
what_sampling_does_not_reach:
  metrics: never, per decision:metrics-are-not-sampled
  logs: never; a severity filter is what bounds api:logger, and dropping records because their trace was not recorded would remove the one signal an unsampled request still has
  query_records: never; requirement:query-diagnostics is a development aid with its own gate, and data:query-record already carries the span id that correlates it if the span was kept
  the_word_already_in_use: pw buildRuntimeHandler calls a span nobody exports unsampled, which is a cost argument rather than a sampling decision; this requirement gives the word its real meaning and that comment needs rewording
acceptance:
  - always_off records no span, allocates no span data, and still injects a traceparent with flags 00
  - traceidratio at a given ratio makes the same decision for the same trace id on two processes
  - a child span never disagrees with its root about being recorded
  - a request arriving with a sampled remote parent is recorded under every parentbased sampler
  - a request arriving with an unsampled remote parent records nothing, and the outbound traceparent it injects keeps flags 00
  - an unsampled request still emits api:logger records carrying its trace id and span id
  - an unsampled statement still produces a requirement:query-diagnostics record when that gate is on
  - the exporter queue receives nothing from an unsampled trace, and no dropped-record count moves
  - pw dev records every trace with no sampler configured
  - a process started with APP_ENV stg or prod and no sampler configured records a tenth of the traces it roots, and one started with an extension token does the same
  - an explicitly configured sampler produces the same behavior under every environment token
  - policy:startup-summary names the sampler, the ratio, and where each came from, including default-by-environment
  - the same sampler configuration governs both transports, per requirement:second-build-feature-parity
non_goals:
  - tail sampling, which needs the finished trace and therefore a collector; this requirement leaves that where the package comment already put it
  - keeping a trace because it failed or was slow, which is tail sampling stated as a wish — the decision here is made before the outcome exists
  - a per-route, per-method, or per-status sampler, which multiplies the configuration surface and still cannot see an outcome
  - a rate-limiting sampler, which makes the decision depend on process-local traffic and so breaks the agreement between two services that consistent ratio sampling buys
  - sampling any signal other than traces
  - consistent probability sampling with a tracestate threshold, which is still moving upstream; the deterministic trace-id rule above is the stable subset of it
open:
  span_object_for_an_unsampled_trace:
    settled: per call, holding only the span context and the parent pointer; a shared value would have no parent to point at, and Parent and Root are pointer chases requirement:context-lookup-performance keeps free
    remaining_cost: WithAttributes copies its input where the option is built, at the call site, so an unsampled span still pays for a slice it never keeps
  the_ratio: 0.1 is a number the framework had to pick rather than a measured one, and the first deployment on the direct route is what sets it
  staging_wants_complete_traces: one rule for every non-dev token gives stg a ratio where the traffic is low and the traces are being read by a person; whether stg earns a third branch or just an entry in the scaffolded configuration file
  compensation_for_what_is_dropped: requirement:local-jsonl-log-capture persists log records and not spans, so a sampled-out incident is investigated from logs; whether that is enough is a question for the first deployment that runs a low ratio
  deployed_debug_class: requirement:deployed-debug-information names a deployed environment that is deliberately debuggable, and it takes the sampled default today because its token is not dev
