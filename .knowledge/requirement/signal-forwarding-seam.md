title: Signal Forwarding Seam
---
The live loop classifies a yielded signal, writes it as a record, and keeps ranging, because system:tinybind v0.5.3 forwards signals through the error slot this framework's loop currently treats as fatal.

```yaml
status: shipped 2026-08-11, the same day upstream shipped its half; the client half is requirement:client-signal-registry and is not built
as_built:
  loop: pw/live.go classifies with htmlbind.AsSignal ahead of every failure branch, writes the record, and continues
  both_backends: pwfast/live.go carries the same classification, because it is a second reading of the same protocol and a backend that ended its stream on the first signal would answer a different wire from the same page
  prefix_is_shared: the reserved prefix and its check are pwruntime's rather than either loop's, since a namespace one backend guarded and the other did not would be reachable through the second
  fasthttp_had_no_live_tests_at_all: three were added with the fix, which is the first coverage that loop has had
  record: pwruntime WriteLiveSignal, beside the delivery and close writers
  surface: pw/signal.go aliases the module's type and re-exports its constructors, so an application names no dependency
  observability: pw.live.signals and pw.live.signal_bytes on the render span, plus a zero-length span event per signal
  tests: seven in pw, covering a signal mid-stream, the record shape, a clause that declares recover, both reserved prefixes, a response of only signals, and a real failure still ending the subscription
  mutation_checked: reverting the classification fails five of the seven, so the regression they exist for is the one they catch
upstream: the signal emission, the Go type, the name grammar, and the reserved prefix are system:tinybind v0.5.3, which specified this framework's obligations rather than leaving them to be inferred
what_upstream_settled_that_this_framework_had_open:
  classification_placement: verified upstream that no caller-side placement works, which is the finding this framework reached independently against v0.5.1 and could not act on
  carrier: the error slot, on the fs.SkipDir precedent
  never_terminal: a signal ends no subscription and renders no recover subtree
  naming: Signal rather than event, because event is taken twice upstream; the client API keeps the registerEvent spelling, which upstream declines to specify at all
the_break:
  fact: the live loop was written as range over RenderChainLive with a non-nil error ending it, which is exactly the shape upstream names as broken by this change
  where: pw/live.go, whose every error branch reported and broke
  failure_mode_if_missed: the loop returns on the first signal, the response ends with no terminal record, the client reads that as truncation and reconnects — so a working signal looks like a flaky connection rather than like an error
  compiles_either_way: the bump produces no build error, so nothing but a test stands between the old loop and that behaviour; this is why the two land together
  therefore: the version bump and this change land in one commit, and bumping alone is worse than not bumping
the_bump_carried_more:
  found: v0.5.3 emits route decoders that read their inputs through pw.Queries, pw.PathValue, and pw.QueryLookup rather than off the request, and none of the three existed here
  effect: every generated page with a dynamic segment or a query parameter stopped compiling, which is unrelated to signals and arrived in the same version
  why_upstream_is_right: a method on the concrete net/http type is a call the fasthttp source transform cannot rewrite, so a decoder spelled r.PathValue would refuse the handler around it; the move is the accessor shape policy:request-scoped-accessor-shape already argues for, applied to generated code
  done_here: the three added to pw over the module's own, their counterparts added to api:pwfast-package, and the two taking the transport registered per requirement:pw-call-registration
  the_guard_worked: the registration test named both unregistered entries by hand, which is the failure mode that requirement predicted and the reason the test exists
  fixture: the page tree fixture regenerated, and its decoder assertion now pins the pw spelling rather than the request-method one, so a regression back to r.PathValue fails here rather than in a fasthttp build nobody runs by default
loop_shape:
  classify_first: htmlbind.AsSignal before any failure handling, so the failure branches below keep the behaviour they have
  on_a_signal: write the record, count it, and continue ranging; no render trace failure, no close reason change, no watchdog reset decision inherited from a delivery
  on_anything_else: unchanged, including the UnrecoveredError branch and the uncommitted-response branch that still becomes an api:problem-response
  errors_is_convenience: htmlbind.ErrSignal answers the classification alone; reading the name and payload needs AsSignal, and this loop needs both
record:
  shape: upstream's, one record kind on the ndjson stream beside the delivery and the terminal records, per the wire contract v0.5.3 publishes
  written_where: this framework's live writer, alongside writeLiveDelivery and writeLiveClose, since decision:live-delivery-transport keeps the framing on this side
  carries_no_boundary_state: no id, no validator, no revision, because a signal addresses no region; the suppression path of api:live-delivery-protocol therefore does not apply to it
  idle_bound: a signal is activity, on the same reasoning a suppressed delivery is — the source produced something, so closing the stream would cost a page execution to learn it again
  observability: signals written and bytes, on the render span beside the delivery counters, because a screen driven entirely by signals is otherwise indistinguishable from an idle one
the_framework_prefix:
  fact: upstream reserves tb. and enforces it at construction; the layered pattern it settled is that every layer producing signals reserves a prefix and guards it
  why_it_cannot_be_upstream: a constructor is called at a yield site inside a source and is not render-scoped, so it can reach no configured prefix
  what_it_protects: requirement:client-signal-registry dispatches lifecycle names under pw., and a handler trusts them because application data has no route to that namespace
  enforced_at_the_seam_not_the_constructor:
    upstream_pattern: a wrapper constructor that refuses the prefix, mirroring how tb. is refused
    departed_from_because:
      no_message: the fault field is the module's and unexported, so a wrapper cannot say why it refused; it could only produce one of upstream's own faults, which would name the wrong prefix
      not_a_chokepoint: an application calling htmlbind.NewSignal directly bypasses every wrapper this package could offer, so a constructor guard is advice rather than enforcement
    chosen: the live loop refuses a pw.-prefixed name, drops the record, and logs it with the name and the reason
    why_it_holds: this loop is the only path a signal reaches a client through, so a name refused here cannot reach one by any route
    residual: the refusal is a runtime log rather than a construction fault, so a wrong name is caught on first emit rather than at the call site; a generation-time check has nothing to inspect, since a name is a runtime string
bounds:
  per_record: upstream states a maximum per record
  aggregate: this framework's, because policy:live-subscription-bounds is where a live response's cost is already counted and an unbounded emitter is a new way to spend it
  open_upstream: whether a per-response rate or byte bound belongs upstream or with the lifecycle bounds, which is an open question there and a reason not to invent a second dial here yet
entries_that_do_not_forward:
  document: upstream's first milestone leaves the document entry out, because those bytes are being consumed by an HTML parser and no inert framing is specified
  consequence_here: a signal emitted before the first delivery, during the document render, is not delivered at all — it is not held for the connection the marker invites
  earlier_draft_was_wrong: this framework had specified deferring such a signal to the live connection, which upstream lists as an open question leaning refused, since holding one needs the queue the design declines to build
  authoring_consequence: a signal that must be seen on first paint has no channel today, and rule:client-event-authoring says so rather than letting it be discovered
  bot_and_buffered: the synchronous entry discards, so requirement:bot-synchronous-render needs no signal-aware path
fan_out:
  finding: upstream's payload-trust rule names the leak this framework had not — a source sharing one upstream across subscriptions emits every signal to every subscriber, so a payload meant for one user reaches all of them
  why_it_bites_here_specifically: policy:live-subscription-bounds already tells applications that sharing an upstream inside the source is how fan-out is done, so the framework recommended the shape that carries the hazard
  not_enforceable: nothing can tell an addressed instruction from a shared one, so it is rule:client-event-authoring rather than a check
acceptance:
  - a source yielding a signal keeps delivering afterwards, and the boundary's content is unchanged by it
  - a signal from a clause with no recover subtree does not end the response
  - a response carrying only signals still closes with a terminal record rather than looking truncated
  - a source emitting a name under either reserved prefix fails at emit rather than reaching a client
  - a project whose sources emit nothing streams byte-identically to what it does today
  - the version bump and this loop change land in one commit, because either alone is a regression
non_goals:
  - a signal from anywhere but a live source, which upstream leaves open and which needs a carrier it has not chosen
  - a queue, a cursor, or replay, per upstream's best-effort statement
  - inspecting, routing on, or rewriting a payload, which upstream guarantees this framework does not do
open_questions:
  - whether a signal should count toward the idle bound at all, given a chat source that only ever emits is a screen with nothing to re-render and a connection worth keeping
  - whether the aggregate bound is a byte count or a rate, and whether refusing is closing the stream or dropping the record
