title: Client Signal Registry
---
One table of named callbacks the page registers at load, which both a server-authored signal and this framework's own lifecycle names dispatch into, scoped so a handler registered on one route is unreachable from another.

```yaml
status: shipped 2026-08-11, except the automatic emission of the scope element, which needs a generator change upstream
as_built:
  table: boundary.js holds the map and the active scope set, declared above the first customElements.define
  published: registerEvent, unregisterEvent, activeScope, and definePage on the framework's namespace object, beside subscribe rather than merged into it
  page_lifecycle:
    shape: definePage(hash, {enter, leave}), with the pw-page element's reactions driving both
    why: it separates a page's evaluation, which an ES module does once, from its activation, which happens on every entry; declaring the lifecycle is what lets setup run again with nothing re-evaluated
    handle: enter receives a handle whose registrations are released on leave, so the ordinary case needs no cleanup and a forgotten one cannot re-register on every revisit
    responsibility_is_still_available: unregisterEvent and the release each registration returns, for a handler an author wants gone early or wants to outlive the page
    two_bugs_the_harness_caught:
      late_definition: an element upgrades while the document parses and a page's module is deferred, so the scope opens before any definition exists; without a catch-up in definePage, enter never ran at all
      leave_ordering: closing the scope before running leave handed a leave handler a table its own registrations had already dropped out of, so the page is left first and the scope closes after
  scope_element: a pw-page custom element whose connect and disconnect reactions are the whole page-scope lifecycle
  lifecycle: document_committed, document_truncated, boundary_settled, live_opened, live_closed, and delivery_applied dispatch locally under the pw. prefix
  record: the signal record is read in the live reader and dispatched by name
  harness: pw/testdata/signal_harness.mjs loads boundary.js for real and covers resolution, scoping, the swap overlap, handler isolation, and reentrancy; the update harness stubs this half, so it needed its own
  whole_lifecycle_set: all eight names dispatch; navigation_applied and directive_received fire on the update half's paths, which is the only place either is observable
  signals_on_the_delta_stream: the navigation reader dispatches a signal record too, since the delta and the live stream are one record grammar written by one encoder upstream and a client reading only the live one would drop what the other carries
implements: the client obligations system:tinybind v0.5.3 specifies, which name registerEvent as this framework's spelling and decline to specify anything else about it
runtime: requirement:unified-update-runtime, so this adds a table to one asset rather than an asset
owned_here: the table, the registration API, the route scoping, the dispatch, and the lifecycle producer
owned_upstream: the record shape, the name grammar, the reserved prefix, the ordering guarantee, the lifecycle name set, and every obligation below that is called normative
one_table:
  rule: a server-authored signal and a lifecycle name dispatch through the same registry
  why: a handler cares what happened rather than which side noticed, and two registries would make every handler pick a side
  supersedes: this framework's earlier split into a lifecycle subscribe surface beside an application registry, which was drafted before upstream settled the question and would have put the reserved names somewhere an author could shadow them
  separation_is_the_prefix: enforced at emit rather than at dispatch, so a client trusts a reserved name without checking anything
lifecycle_names:
  producer: this runtime, locally; none of them crosses the wire, because each describes an arrival and the client is what observes one
  vocabulary: upstream publishes the moments as suffixes to be reused verbatim, so pw.boundary_settled and tb.boundary_settled name one moment at two layers
  set: document_committed, document_truncated, boundary_settled, live_opened, live_closed, delivery_applied, navigation_applied, directive_received
  under: this framework's own prefix, guarded by the constructor of requirement:signal-forwarding-seam so an application cannot emit one
  after_not_before: a lifecycle name fires after the thing it describes is in the DOM, never before, since the whole use is reading or decorating what just arrived
  the_focus_lesson_applies: requirement:update-navigation-continuity learned that acting on a node still inside a fragment does nothing at all, silently, which is the same failure a handler would hit
  zero_server_side: every fact these carry is already on the wire, so this costs no Go and no bytes
  local_extension:
    what: delivery_applied additionally reports whether the DOM changed
    why: applyBoundary compares arriving markup against what the range holds and returns without refilling when they match, and the server suppresses that case ahead of it, so an arrival is not a change
    legal: the client observed it, so reporting it needs nothing the wire does not carry, which is the test upstream sets for adding to this set
    what_it_prevents: a handler flashing a region on every reconnect, and an analytics call reporting change counts as source yields
plumbing:
  where_the_table_belongs: boundary.js, because requirement:unified-update-runtime fixes the load order and boundary.js is first; update.js already imports applyHTML, readRecords, resolveNavigable, and stopLive from it
  precedent: the shared client-state core, which both halves call and a test asserts is declared exactly once; the table is the second thing of that shape and takes the same guard
  why_it_cannot_be_the_update_half: the boundary half runs when updates are disabled, and a live page with no update surface still receives signals
  relation_to_subscribe: api:client-update-api keeps its own lifecycle kinds for the update paths it already reports on; this table is not a rename of that surface and the two are not merged, because those kinds report an outcome to the caller that asked for it
route_scoping:
  problem: a navigation delta reuses the live document rather than reparsing it, so the outgoing page's handlers stay registered and the incoming page's script does not run
  verified: pw/update.js leaves a script already in the head alone, calling out that re-inserting would fetch and re-execute; so a page's module runs on first arrival and never again
  re_execution_is_not_available: an ES module is evaluated once per URL and a dynamic import returns the cached instance, so any design depending on running a page's registrations again cannot work
  chosen: a catalog of declaration to module URL on the wire, and the DOM as the mount list
  per_instance_since_v0_5_7:
    what_upstream_shipped: Scope normalized up to the package-qualified identity, and the same string written onto every rendered instance as static markup, which is what closed the identity mismatch that blocked this
    why_the_marker_is_static_rather_than_beside_the_instance_id: an ordinary component call opens no update boundary, so a component rendered twenty times inside a page carries no instance id and appears in no manifest — precisely the case a per-instance lifecycle exists for; a static attribute also survives a render that collects nothing and a first load, where the client holds no manifest because the manifest is a header the client sends back
    catalog_not_a_mount_list: Assets reports what a composition could require, including a component below a slot that never rendered, so the wire carries it as a lookup table and the DOM decides what starts
    ordering_falls_out: a tree walk finds an ancestor's marker before a descendant's, which is the outermost-first rule without an ordering on the wire
    release_needed_no_wire_change: the subtree about to be replaced is still the one every setup inside it ran against, so the apply loop scans it and tears down before the incoming markup lands; upstream corrected its own earlier claim that this needed the component to become an update boundary
    where_it_is_wired: the shared swap and the live refill, for the reason the client-state core lives there — a delta, a redraw, an action response and a delivery all destroy a region, and a release missing from one is a leak nobody would find
    setup_signature: the element first, matching what a setup is for, and a scope second whose registrations release with the instance; a forgotten cleanup now leaks once per destroyed instance rather than once per visit
    supersedes: the composition chain this framework shipped first, which was correct only for chain members because they have one instance each
    verified: every wire mutation-checked through the apply loop rather than through the primitives, after a first pass tested the primitives alone and caught four of them not at all
  element_is_now_the_escape_hatch: pw-page and a hand-written hash stay for a region that is not a chain member, which upstream explicitly leaves to the caller
  why_the_element_beats_the_route_pattern:
    no_wire_change: the hash travels in markup the server already writes, where a pattern needed a new field on the head record and on the delta
    the_lifecycle_is_the_platforms: connectedCallback and disconnectedCallback fire exactly when a region enters and leaves the document, so a delta that swaps the region holding the element resets the scope with nothing here matching a URL
    it_scopes_the_right_thing: a route pattern names a URL shape, where a template names what actually registered the handlers; two routes rendering one template should share, and a page rendering through layouts should not collapse into one scope
    nesting_is_free_and_meaningful: a layout's element and its page's element are both connected, so a layout-scoped handler outlives the pages that share it — which is the global form, falling out rather than being designed
    verified: 2026-08-11; the idea is the user's, and the earlier pattern-on-the-wire proposal is withdrawn
  overlap_during_a_swap: a delta may insert the replacement before removing the outgoing element, so a disconnect deactivates only when no other element still carries that hash
  where_the_hash_comes_from:
    exists_already: the action endpoint path is sha256 of the declaring directory and the handler name, so a stable per-page digest is a thing generation already computes
    not_yet_emitted: no generator writes a pw-page element, so an application writes the tag by hand today; the requirement on a hash is only that it be stable and unique per template, which a hand-written string satisfies
    ask: emitting it per page template, which is where this stops being an application's job
  how_a_module_learns_its_own_hash_resolved:
    inline_script: an intrinsic, which flow:template-generation already contemplates — concept:interaction-cost-ladder script_braces names an intrinsic as one of the ways a brace in script content is resolved, so the author writes the hash as an interpolation and generation supplies it
    external_module: the element names the module rather than the module naming the hash, so there is nothing to inject; the contract is one named export, setup(page), optionally returning a teardown
    why_not_rewriting_the_script_block:
      it_means_parsing_javascript: definePage can be aliased, destructured, called through a variable, or appear in a string or a comment, so matching the call site in source works in a demo and fails in a project
      it_reaches_only_inline_blocks: an external module is not in the template, and the external module is the path a strict script-src leaves open
      it_edits_authored_code: this framework's line is that generated code is generated and authored code is authored, and rewriting the body of a script an author wrote crosses it
    module_attribute_as_built:
      import_is_cached: the module is evaluated once, as an ES module always is, and what runs per entry is the function it exported — which is the distinction the whole design rests on
      same_origin_only: refused otherwise, so a templating mistake or an injected attribute cannot turn into a script host of somebody else's choosing, which is the one thing the upstream no-code-transfer obligation cannot survive
      loaded_once_per_hash: a second element carrying the same hash reuses the definition rather than importing again
      release_guard_narrowed: the release build asserted no dynamic import at all, which held only while the development console was the sole reason to have one; it now asserts no dynamic import of a literal path, which is the shape the development import takes and the only one that can name a module outside the served set
  how_a_module_learns_its_own_hash:
    the_gap: a page's module cannot read the hash off its own tag, since a module script has no document.currentScript, and cannot be handed it by an inline script under a strict script-src
    not_blocking: policy:security-response-headers leaves the CSP to the application, and templates may carry script, so a project that allows inline script interpolates the hash directly
    for_a_strict_csp: the resolution is a module attribute on the element, imported on connect and handed a scope object, which also makes setup run per activation rather than once; not built, and worth building only when a project needs it
  reset_falls_out: a handler belonging to another page is unreachable, which is the reset behaviour with nothing cleared
  return_falls_out: coming back makes the same closures reachable again, because they never went away and nothing has to re-run
  global_form: a site-wide handler registered from a shell script says so, since it belongs to no one page
  what_it_is_for: two pages both naming a signal finish or refresh is likely rather than exotic, and without a scope the second page's signal runs the first page's handler
  not_for_stale_delivery: the live request is aborted before navigation operations are applied, so a signal for the outgoing page cannot fire against the incoming one; upstream states this as a normative obligation
  pattern_not_path:
    chosen: room/2 and room/3 share one registration, which is correct rather than a compromise — the handler expresses what the application does when a room finishes, and that is the same in every room
    the_instance_is_not_the_handlers_business: a source emitting from room 3 knows it is room 3 and says so in the payload, from the same execution that rendered the page
    exact_path_rejected: it keeps one dead registration per room ever visited and leaves every room after the first with an empty registry
    filtering_is_the_wrong_frame: there is no other room's signal to filter out, because the connection is opened against location.href and aborted on navigation; the defect it appeared to answer was a handler closing over an id at registration, which no dispatch test repairs
  answers_an_upstream_open_question: whether a registration may be replaced or removed after load is left open upstream, and route ownership is this framework's answer to the part of it that matters
  accumulation: one closure per registration per route visited in a session, worth a bound only if a session can reach unboundedly many routes
dispatch:
  resolution: a byte-for-byte lookup in this table and nothing else — never eval, new Function, import, a global property lookup by name, or an attribute handler
  why_it_is_the_whole_point: the flexibility comes from the payload varying, not from the instruction varying; what the client can be told to do is fixed at build time and is exactly what its table holds
  unknown_name: ignored and counted, never resolved dynamically; a deploy that adds a name to the server ahead of the client is ordinary
  registration_before_dispatch: names are registered while the page loads, before any live-mode request is issued, since nothing is held to replay what arrived first
  empty_registry_is_no_authority: a page that has published nothing grants nothing; deferring a signal until a handler appears would make the check pass on timing
  at_most_once: dispatched once, and never for a request this client aborted
  order: record order, synchronously with reading, which is what makes a source's signal fire before the delivery_applied of the delivery that followed it
  handler_isolation: a throwing handler is caught and reported and the apply loop continues, because a bug in a toast handler must not stop deliveries from landing
  no_veto: a handler observes and cannot cancel, defer, or alter what it was told about
capability_reading:
  what_the_table_is: the published set of entry points a render may invoke, so the effects a server can cause are enumerable from the application's own source
  what_it_is_not: a defense against a hostile same-origin server, which can serve different JavaScript; it bounds mistakes and blast radius, the same scoping api:client-update-api states about its own surface
  the_authority_is_the_argument_surface: matching a name is checked and what a handler does with an arbitrary payload is not, which rule:client-event-authoring carries
  scoping_narrows_it: the published set is route and name rather than name
supplied_handlers:
  what: this framework ships handler implementations an author registers, rather than handlers it registers itself
  why_not_pre_registered: a pre-registered handler is a capability the page never published, which is the ambient authority the model exists to remove
  first_one: a navigate handler resolving the target, refusing anything not same-origin, and taking the navigation delta path when updates are installed and an ordinary document load otherwise
  what_it_saves: the origin check and the soft-or-hard branch, which is the part an author gets wrong rather than the part that expresses intent
  origin_check_lives_in_it: resolveNavigable accepts any http or https origin plus mailto and tel, while api:client-update-api states same-origin only and never a URL derived from page content; a supplied handler settles that once instead of in every application
  registered_per_route: like any other handler, so it is published where it is used
  distinct_from_the_directive: navigate and reload are reserved control records the runtime already acts on; a supplied handler is what an application signal reaches
conformance:
  harness: the node suite of requirement:unified-update-runtime, extended over the record, the name grammar, unknown names, ordering against deliveries, abort discipline, and a throwing handler
  why_here: upstream's harness refuses a JavaScript entry surface, so a client written against the contract is tested on this side or nowhere
  registering_through_the_public_api: is the feature rather than an exposed internal, which upstream flags as needing to be stated rather than assumed
acceptance:
  - a page with a strict script-src carrying neither unsafe-eval nor unsafe-inline dispatches every signal with no violation
  - an application registers one table and receives both a server-authored signal and a lifecycle name through it
  - a name with no registration does nothing, is counted, and the stream continues
  - two signals in one response fire in the order the server wrote them
  - a signal on a request this client aborted is not dispatched
  - a handler for delivery_applied reads the new content from the DOM with no observer of its own, and learns whether anything changed
  - a handler registered on one route is unreachable from another, and reachable again on return with nothing re-executed
  - a throwing handler does not stop the next delivery from landing
non_goals:
  - a declarative attribute naming a handler, which is inline script with the CSP protection removed
  - replacing the api:client-update-api subscribe kinds, which report an outcome to the caller that asked for it
  - a client-to-server channel, which stays flow:partial-refresh and api:server-action
open_questions:
  - whether delivery_applied is worth per-instance subscription, since a busy dashboard fires it hundreds of times a minute and a handler filtering afterwards pays for every one
  - whether an application may opt out of lifecycle dispatch to save the per-application call
  - whether the route pattern on the wire is worth its string, or whether an exact-path key plus a documented re-registration idiom is cheaper than it looks
```
