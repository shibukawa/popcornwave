title: Reloadable Component Endpoint
---
A component declared reloadable can be re-rendered on its own by naming its instance and supplying its inputs, answered at the page URL it sits on with no page execution and no manifest.

```yaml
source: decision:update-runtime-convergence
different_question: requirement:navigation-delta-rendering answers what changed on this page; this answers render this one region again with these values
declaration:
  syntax: a reloadable modifier after export on the component declaration in a .pw.html source
  generated: a typed query decoder, a kind identity, and a registration value
  id_parameter: a required string id the author writes at the call site, filled from the instance header on a redraw
  diagnostics_are_errors:
    - the component must be exported, single rooted, and not the document shell
    - every parameter other than id must be a type a query string carries deterministically, so a record, a slice, and html are refused
    - unlike an automatic boundary these fail generation, because the author asked for the endpoint
kind:
  value: the component name plus a hash of its parameters and compiled markup
  purpose: version, so editing the template changes the kind and a page loaded before a deploy gets a 404 and reloads rather than rendering under changed semantics
  does_not_cover: the package, so two templates identical in name, parameters, and markup collide
  guard: registering one kind twice fails at startup rather than overwriting, since identical plan text still resolves its external calls per package; it returns an error rather than panicking, so a generated registry reports it as a startup diagnostic
  on_the_element: every render writes the kind beside the instance id, so a region stays redrawable after a redraw replaced it
registration:
  explicit: being exported and single rooted is not enough, because answering for a component must be a deliberate act
  where: the generated api:page-registry Register, which is already the one symbol an application touches to install a page tree
  application_visible: the registration value exists in Go, so a reviewer reads the published set from source rather than from templates
  outside_a_page_tree: a registered-router project installs the value itself, since it owns its own mux
no_longer_an_endpoint:
  since: system:tinybind v0.3.5, which answered docs/tinybind-go-client-ownership-request.md in full
  what_changed: redraw became a negotiated request mode carried on the shared render header, with the component named by kind and instance headers rather than by a URL path
  so: a redraw is answered at the page's own URL by the handler that renders it, and the reserved-prefix route is gone
  why_it_had_to: path protection is configured by path pattern, so a redraw on a reserved path needed a second pattern kept in step with the one protecting the page the component sits on, and nothing forced the two to agree
  what_it_inherits_now: the page's middleware, and for a handler that owns its own body, that handler's authorization as well
  addressing_was_the_module_s: the browser half built the URL, so this framework could not move an endpoint it served; that is the coupling the request named and the release removed
  stale_build: no longer refused, because at a page URL the right answer to a stale redraw is the page the caller was about to render anyway
as_built:
  what_was_missing: system:tinybind emits the registration value, and pw exported the call that consumes it, but nothing joined them, so every project published an empty registry and every redraw answered 404
  two_entries:
    explicit: pw Redraw takes the components this handler answers for, placed after that handler's own authorization; the named set is what bounds the surface, so a page cannot be asked to render a component it never shows
    page_tree: the render entry answers from the process-wide published set, because a generated route handler has no seam of its own; it runs after Load, so the page's authorization has already run and already returned its own error
    cost_of_the_page_tree_half: the data fetch the redraw did not need, and a set bounded by the deployment rather than by the page; a handler that owns its body takes the explicit entry instead
  mechanism: pw generate derives an init beside each compiled template from the registration value in that template's own generated source, exactly as requirement:dynamodb-migration derives its table registration
  derived_not_re_read: the marker is the emitted 'var NameReloadable = htmlupdate.Reloadable{', so what publishes an endpoint is what the annotation produced and nothing re-decides it; a component with no annotation regenerates byte for byte
  declaration: the '@reloadable' annotation above 'export component' in a .pw.html source, which is the deliberate act; the generated init decides nothing
  not_the_page_registry:
    planned: registration inside the generated Register of api:page-registry
    why_not: a reloadable component is an ordinary component compiled by the flat generator run, and a page tree's registry is written before that run has read one; every generated import of a tree points down the tree, so a registry naming a components package outside it would be the one import direction that placement rule forbids
    what_replaces_it: the component's own package registers itself, which is the same shape decision:implicit-document-shell already uses for the document
    unchanged: a registered-router project still installs the value itself, and the exported call is the same one
  linkage_is_the_condition: an init runs because a build linked its package, which is the right rule rather than a gap; a reloadable component is reached from the page or handler that renders it, and one nothing links is one no rendered element carries the kind of, so nothing could address it
  startup_diagnostic: RegisterReloadable keeps its first failure as well as returning it, and api:application-lifecycle answers it before the port is bound, because the generated init has nowhere to return one to and a panic there would end the process before any logging exists to name the collision
  reported_whatever_updates_say: a collision is a defect in what generation produced rather than a deployment choice, so it is refused even with html.update.enabled false, where a duplicate would otherwise wait silently for the first deployment that turns updates on
  shell_head_not_wired:
    what: the registry reports RequiredHead and RequiredAssets and nothing here reads them, so a first appearance is covered by the response header alone
    judged_acceptable: 2026-08-04, and the reason is that the flash this would prevent cannot happen in this project's configuration
    why_not: requirement:component-asset-extraction is unasked for, so a component's style and script reach the head inline rather than as a link; installing an inline tag before the swap is synchronous and there is nothing to fetch mid-swap
    also: a project styles from one shell stylesheet under requirement:tailwind-css-integration or requirement:public-asset-delivery, where no component brings a tag the document never had
    the_real_residual: registration refuses a component whose transitive head passes the module's two-kilobyte header bound, and the remedy that error names is exactly this shell set, so what is unbuilt costs a large inline style block rather than an unstyled region
    revisit_when: component asset extraction is enabled, which turns every contribution into a link and makes the mid-swap fetch real
  still_open:
    doctor: rule:route-and-template-checks does not yet report the published set, so the review point the authorization rule names has no diagnostic behind it
request:
  shape: 'GET <the page url>?<declared parameters>, with the redraw mode on the render header and the kind and instance on headers of their own'
  build_check: a request from another build is left to the page rather than refused, because a kind is stable across builds and cannot say whether the page asking is current; the page is what the caller was about to render
  bounds: a configured maximum query length, since a GET carries every argument
  decoding: a missing, undecodable, or repeated parameter is an error, never a zero value
response:
  body: that component's subtree as one root element carrying the same id
  headers: private and no-cache, the served mode echoed on the render header, and a keyed ETag over the rendered bytes
  conditional: an unchanged region costs a 304, which is what makes a polled redraw cheap without a manifest; the ETag is keyed for the same reason the validators are
  privacy: private rather than public, because the URL alone identifies a usually per-user response
  failure: an unknown kind is 404, an oversized query is 414, a bad argument is 400, and each falls back to a complete page load on the client; a stale build is no longer a refusal
  failure_visibility: every refusal reaches this framework through the hook of api:html-update-options, so it is logged and rendered like any other failure rather than written as plain text by the module
  head: from system:tinybind v0.3.3 both halves are covered without changing the body, which stays a bare subtree so what curl sees is unchanged
  guarantee_side: the registry reports the head and assets of every published component, so the document shell installs them once at startup and covers every redraw of that deployment
  report_side: a redraw of a component that contributes head announces those tags on a response header, and the runtime installs what is missing before replacing the region
  bound: the head one component may carry is checked when it is registered rather than per request, because a component's head is a static declaration and an oversized one is a startup fact
authorization:
  new_surface: yes, and it is the whole cost of this capability
  rule: a registered component receives whatever the caller sends, where a component argument used to be a value the page had already authenticated and authorized
  safe: a component that only formats values handed to it
  unsafe_without_a_check: one that loads a record by identifier, which must verify ownership or visibility itself exactly as a handler does
  review_point: registration; rule:route-and-template-checks reports the published set so a project can review it, and api:cli-doctor names it
  path_protection: policy:authenticated-path-protection patterns apply to the prefix like any other path
  csrf: a redraw is a side-effect-free GET, so policy:csrf-protection does not gate it; origin defence still applies to a credentialed read
idempotence:
  rule: a redraw must be repeatable with no observable effect, because it is retried on supersession and may be answered from a cache
  privacy: per-user output is private, since the URL alone identifies the response
guidance:
  prefer_navigation: state that can live in the URL belongs there, where requirement:navigation-delta-rendering already handles it and the user gets a shareable, bookmarkable page
  earns_its_keep: widget-local state that should not appear in a shareable URL, or a region whose inputs the browser genuinely owns
  no_third_mode: re-running the handler with one patched parameter cannot reach the data fetch that produced the component's other inputs, so a patched sort order never reaches the query
acceptance:
  - a registered component renders from a URL with no page execution
  - an unregistered component has no endpoint, even when it is exported and single rooted
  - a template edit changes the endpoint URL and a page loaded before the deploy falls back to a full load
  - a second redraw of the same region succeeds, because the replacement carries the kind again
  - a component loading a record by identifier is reported by rule:route-and-template-checks as a registration to review
  - registering two components that hash to one kind fails startup validation with a diagnostic naming both, rather than aborting the process
  - a redraw whose region did not change answers 304
  - a refused redraw appears in the request log with its cause, and version skew is distinguishable from a decoding failure
