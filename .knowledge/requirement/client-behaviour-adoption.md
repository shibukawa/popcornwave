title: Client Behaviour Adoption
---
system:tinybind v0.5.8 shipped the four asks of docs/tinybind-go-actions-and-handlers-request.md, so what remains is this framework's half: a JavaScript parser behind the reporting seam, four attribute names, a runtime that binds what the lowering now emits, and three things that break a page rather than degrade it if they are missed.

```yaml
source: the v0.5.8 client behaviour document, verified against the module source 2026-08-12
verified_against_the_code:
  reporting_seam: templates/htmlbind/script_report.go ComponentScripts returns Component, Script, Pos, Handlers and Parameters, and runs the same analysis Generate does
  answer_seam: GenerateOptions ClientHandlers, ClientHandlerAttr, ComponentParameters and ComponentParameterAttr, plus Result.ComponentScripts for a compile that already ran
  tree_seam: routetree GenerateOptions.ScriptResolver returning ScriptAnswers, and ClientHandlerAttr and ComponentParameterAttr on the emitter
  dispatch: httpbind.ActionSelector reads the query before the body, and httpbind.DispatchAction applies the 303 when the handler wrote nothing
  defaults: data-tb-action, data-tb-on, data-tb-props, _action, _csrf
  parity: fasthttpbind carries its own action dispatch, so requirement:alternate-http-backend-readiness is not regressed by adopting this
what_upstream_answered_differently_and_better:
  no_action_attribute: the form carries method=post and no action at all, so a native submit goes to the document URL, which already holds this page's path parameters and keeps its query; decision:action-entry-point-selection asked for the page pattern to be written in and this is the same destination with nothing to write
  selector_in_a_hidden_field: _action carrying hash and name, read by ActionSelector with the query winning over the body so a submit button's formaction can override the form
  the_page_registers_post: only when a template declares a form action, which is why a bare button's direct endpoint stays the only address that answers for it
three_things_that_break_a_page:
  csrf_option_is_mandatory:
    rule: a render reaching an unsafe form with no token fails with ErrNoCSRFToken rather than emitting an empty field
    already_satisfied: requirement:module-native-csrf added the option in the one document render entry every page branch funnels through, and states the sessionless case as a deliberate failure
    what_changed: one form now makes this true for every render of that page, so a page that never had an unsafe form can acquire one by adopting a server action
  post_collision:
    rule: a page whose template declares a form action registers POST on its own path beside its GET, and a hand-registered POST at the same address panics decision:stdlib-servemux at startup
    who_can_hit_it: a page-tree project that already hand-registers a POST at a page path, which is legal today because the tree registered only GET there; adopting a form action on that page is what turns a working pair into a panic
    reproduced: 2026-08-12, by registering POST on the fixture's page path before pages.Register
    the_check_it_seemed_to_need_is_worth_less_than_it_looked:
      what_the_panic_already_says: both patterns, both registration sites, each with a file and a line, one of which is the generated registry and the other the application's own
      so: it is a startup failure that names its own cause, which is the outcome a doctor check would have been buying
      and_a_check_cannot_see_it_anyway: analysis skips a file carrying the generated header, deliberately, or a page registry read back as a source would turn every page into a documented API route; the page POST is registered only there
      therefore: the RouteTable input PW0201 declares would not carry this pattern even once it exists, so closing it means analysis reading generated registrations for one purpose while excluding them for another
    what_is_worth_doing_instead: documenting the upgrade hazard where a project adopts a form action, since the panic is legible and the surprise is only that generation added a registration
  csrf_field_name_is_not_forwarded:
    fact: CSRFFieldName and CSRFMode are templates/htmlbind options and routetree forwards neither, so a page tree always emits _csrf and always emits it
    bites_us_when: a project configures another field name, which policy:csrf-protection permits while recommending the module default
    answer: refuse a configured field name that is not the module default in a page-tree project, naming this as the reason, rather than emitting a token the middleware will not find
    alternative: ask upstream for the emitter setting, which the document says is available for the asking
this_frameworks_half:
  the_parser:
    what: reads the reported block and answers which names setup returned and which parameters it destructured, per decision:script-block-parsing-ownership
    wired_at: the routetree ScriptResolver, which is the seam that was asked for and shipped
    cost: one extra parse per template carrying a block, because the blocks are reported before the compile that consumes the answers
    refusal_is_explicit: an unresolved name is reported with a reason rather than omitted, because an omission cannot be told from a map that was never populated and a mis-read block would then report every name as unknown
    unchecked_is_legal: a component with no entry at all is accepted, which is what lets a first pass run before the parser exists
  four_attribute_names:
    why: DataAttributePrefix renames the boundary and declaration markers and does not reach these four, so a project setting it gets data-pw-component beside data-tb-on
    already_set: ActionAttr, which internal/pwgen has carried since the action endpoint landed
    to_set: ClientHandlerAttr and ComponentParameterAttr, to this framework's prefix
    left_at_the_default: the hidden field names, which are form fields rather than data attributes and which the middleware reads by name
  the_runtime:
    interception_must_move: the submit path keys on a GET form today, and the emitted form now declares method=post, so it stops matching; the key becomes the presence of the action attribute
    what_that_fixes: the GET-form failure requirement:action-invocation-runtime records is closed by the method alone, before any interception is written
    where_to_post:
      form: its own action, which resolves to the document URL and already carries the selector, so no header names the handler
      bare_element: the attribute's direct endpoint, because the page POST is registered only for a handler a form names and would otherwise answer 405
    two_extra_fields: a FormData body carries _action and _csrf beside the author's fields, which the binder ignores because nothing rejects an undeclared field
    redirect_following: the page POST answers 303 by default and fetch follows it, so a caller wanting regions uses the direct endpoint or has the handler write its own response
  binding_the_handlers: requirement:component-script-event-binding, whose emitted shape is now fixed by the module rather than proposed
as_built_2026_08_12:
  version: v0.5.8 adopted, with the configbind bindings regenerated because the dependency map gained a type in the same release
  two_pw_calls_were_missing_and_had_to_exist:
    found: the generated dispatcher calls pw.ActionSelector and pw.DispatchAction, and neither existed, so a page tree declaring a form action did not compile
    not_anticipated_here: this requirement listed four attribute names and two checks and did not name the runtime surface generation calls into, which is the thing that fails first
    built: pw/action.go and pwfast/action.go, wrapping the module's own halves
    the_wrapper_earns_its_place: DispatchAction routes its redirect through Redirect rather than the module's, because the runtime posts an intercepted form to this same route, and a fetch follows a 303 and would apply a whole page where a region set belongs; Redirect already branches on the update mode, so a scriptless submit and an intercepted one each get the answer their own client can use
    guards_caught_both_halves: the pw-call-registration tests refused the new functions until a pattern was registered, and then refused the pattern until pwfast declared a counterpart, which is exactly what requirement:pw-call-registration was written to do
  the_attribute_prefix_was_the_real_question:
    found: UpdateAttributePrefix is tb, deliberately, while PageActionAttr was already data-pw-action, so the document already held two spellings before this feature added two more
    the_stated_reason_was_stale: it said routetree did not thread the prefix, and pwAttributePrefix already records that v0.5.6 closed that and both paths pass the value
    chosen: all three behaviour attributes derive from the one prefix, which moves PageActionAttr to data-tb-action
    why: the runtime builds every attribute name it reads from one configured value, and branding these three would have needed a second constant in the JavaScript to find half of them
    what_it_leaves_open: whether that prefix becomes this framework's brand, which is a decision the tree already records as available and which now moves all four attributes together
  the_page_post_is_not_in_the_route_table:
    found: the generated registry registers POST on the page pattern, and Routes lists only the GETs while Actions lists only the direct endpoints
    consequence: PW0201 exists and cannot see this collision, because the pattern that panics is registered and published nowhere
    so: the collision check is blocked on the route table carrying it, which is an upstream ask rather than work here
  a_malformed_csrf_secret_fails_exactly_like_an_absent_one:
    found: the token derivation decodes the secret and yields nothing when it cannot, so a placeholder secret produces the same ErrNoCSRFToken and the same opaque 500
    where_it_bit: the page tree fixture, which needed a minted secret rather than any string
    worth_stating: the failure a page author meets is a 500 saying internal error, with the reason in the log only, which is the diagnosis gap this requirement should close next
  runtime_interception:
    built: the submit path takes a form naming a server function ahead of the navigation rules, and the click path takes an element no submit event covers
    body: the form's fields plus the pressed button's own pair, and nothing at all for a bare element
    in_flight: the element is marked aria-busy and a second activation is ignored rather than queued, which is the redraw supersession rule inverted because a mutation is not idempotent
    failure: a reload rather than a resubmit, because nothing can tell a request that never arrived from one whose answer was unusable, and resubmitting would perform the mutation twice
    covered: six cases in the conformance harness, including that a plain GET form is still the search form it was
  the_parser_as_built:
    where: internal/pwscript, a scanner rather than a parser
    what_it_skips: a string, a template literal including its interpolations, a line and block comment, and a regular expression literal, which are the four things a pattern match reads wrong; a slash is division or a literal depending on the token before it, and reading that wrong swallows the rest of a file
    what_it_reads: a top-level setup, the parameter names nested under one key in its pattern, and the keys of an object literal returned at the function's own top level
    what_it_declines: a returned variable, a spread, a nested return, and the bag taken whole under one name, each of which leaves the component unchecked rather than half-published
    the_declining_is_the_design: decision:component-handler-namespace records checking as total for the idiomatic shape and partial in general, and a scanner that guessed would publish a handler that does not exist
    wired_at: the routetree ScriptResolver, which refuses a referenced name the block does not return and supplies the reason, while the module supplies the position
    proved: a typo in the fixture fails generation naming the file, line, column, component, the name, and the reason
    unwalkable_is_different_from_unread: a block whose quoting never closes is an error, because that is not this scanner's limit and the browser meets the same source next
  the_signature_migration_and_the_binding:
    built: setup takes one destructured object carrying el, teardown, onSignal and props, and returns the handlers the markup may name
    the_break_was_loud_as_designed: the signal harness failed at once on the fixture still taking positional arguments, which is the property that made a compatibility shim unnecessary and impossible in the same breath
    ordering: a descendant's setup waits for its ancestors to settle and not for its siblings, so an await that never settles stalls its own subtree rather than every remaining component on the page
    binding: after setup returns, the mounted subtree is scanned once and a listener added per declared pair; nothing is recorded for release, because a listener on a node dies with the node and these sit on the nodes a swap destroys
    props: parsed from the emitted attribute, empty rather than absent when unreadable so a destructuring reads undefined instead of throwing
    migrated: two harness fixtures, the page tree fixture, the live_render example and its regenerated asset, and eight documentation pages in both locales
  the_csrf_field_name_check:
    built: a startup refusal when the configured field name is not the one generated forms carry
    why_startup: generation never takes the setting, so the failure it replaces is a 403 on every submission with the reason in the log only, which reads as a broken request rather than as a setting
  documentation:
    added: a server actions guide in both locales, covering which element to choose, what the handler owes, the two entry points and what each carries, the CSRF posture, and the POST registration
    corrected: the interactivity overview said intercepting the click was still the application's, which the runtime interception made false, and the template syntax reference described the bare-element lowering as the only one
    the_recommendation_it_lands: put a server action on a form, because a bare button loses the no-script path and posts to a constant address carrying no path parameters
  what_is_not_done:
    the_post_collision_check: withdrawn rather than blocked; the panic already names both sites, and analysis excludes the generated registry by design
    calling_an_action_without_a_gesture: the actions namespace requirement:action-invocation-runtime designs is not in the bag, so a component script still writes its own fetch; nothing documents it as available
    a_form_action_needs_csrf_turned_on_and_the_scaffold_does_not_always_turn_it_on:
      chain: generation writes the hidden field because the form is unsafe, the render needs a token to fill it, the token comes from a secret, and the secret is minted by the CSRF middleware alone
      so: with security.csrf.enabled false, which is the shipped default, every render of a page declaring a form action fails
      verified: the page tree fixture answered 500 until its requests carried a secret, and setupCSRF returns no middleware at all when the setting is off
      the_scaffold_gap: securityRuntimeConfig writes the whole security section only for a project serving a browser login, so a page-tree project with no login, and a JWT-only one, are scaffolded into exactly that state
      derived_not_run: the scaffold path was read rather than exercised; what was exercised is the render behaviour a project in that state gets
      why_it_is_new: before v0.5.8 a form carrying server-action emitted no token field, so it needed no token; adopting the feature is what makes a working page fail
      what_the_author_sees: a 500 whose body says internal error, because sanitizedProblem strips the cause from every 5xx, which is right in general and wrong for a configuration mistake reported through the same channel
      built_2026_08_12: the render supplies the module's explicit no-token option when the configuration says the check is off, so the form renders unprotected because that is what the deployment asked for
      the_distinction_that_makes_it_safe:
        check_on_and_no_secret: still a failed render; no session, or a store that failed, and rendering an unprotected form would hide it
        check_off: renders, because the choice is in the configuration and this render is reading it
        why_it_does_not_contradict_module_native_csrf: what that requirement refuses is treating an absent token as none wanted, which turns a forgotten option into an unprotected form nobody chose; the setting is not a forgotten option
        the_tests_could_not_tell_them_apart: a bare context reads the zero SecurityConfig where the check is off, so a case meaning no session was also saying no protection wanted, and both now say which they are
      what_it_leaves: the hidden field is still emitted and empty, because the generation-time mode is not threaded into a page tree's compile; removing it is an upstream ask the module has already offered
      why_not_take_that_ask_first:
        coupling: the mode is decided at generation and the setting is read at runtime, so a build with the mode off deployed with the check on would emit forms carrying no token and have every submission refused
        worse_than_today: that fails at submit rather than at render, and the form looks correct while it happens
        so: threading the mode needs a startup guard comparing the two, where reading one runtime value at render time needs none
      scaffold_closed_2026_08_12:
        was: the security section was written for a browser login and nothing else, on the ground that a project with no session has nothing to bind a token to
        why_that_was_already_untrue: sessionRuntimeConfig writes session.enabled unconditionally and says why, that session storage is not a login, so a page-tree project was scaffolded able to hold a secret and configured not to
        now: the section is written for a page tree as well, and the comment it emits names the unsafe route that project actually ships rather than the general case
      rejected: minting a secret regardless of the setting, which would emit a token nothing verifies and make the form look protected when the deployment turned protection off
      also_required_and_not_only_the_check: sessions, since the secret is a session slot and pwsession.Setup returns nothing when session.enabled is false, so csrf.enabled alone is not sufficient
sequencing:
  first: the version bump and the attribute names, since they change generated bytes and nothing else works until the markup is this framework's
  second: the two checks, because both fail a build rather than a request and are cheap
  third: the runtime interception, which is what makes a server action perform its mutation
  fourth: the parser and the handler binding, which are one feature and the largest piece
acceptance:
  - a form carrying server-action reaches its handler with scripting disabled, and is never submitted as a GET
  - the same form is intercepted by the runtime and its response applied
  - a bare button posts to its direct endpoint and never to the page URL
  - a page whose template declares a form action and whose application registers POST at the same path fails a check rather than panicking at startup
  - a project configuring a non-default CSRF field name in a page tree fails with that reason named
  - every attribute this framework's runtime reads carries this framework's prefix
  - a component declaring a script block reports its parameters, and only the destructured ones reach the DOM
  - a project declaring no script block and no server action regenerates byte-identical output
```
