title: Unified Update Runtime
---
One browser asset, popcornweb-runtime.js, carries every client capability the framework owns, so a document declares one module reference whether it streams boundaries, keeps a live connection, applies a navigation delta, redraws a region, or applies an action response.

```yaml
source: decision:update-runtime-convergence
supersedes_delivery_of: requirement:external-boundary-runtime, whose scope becomes one half of this asset rather than its own file
as_built:
  asset: one served file composed at process start from boundary.js, update.js, and a bootstrap that builds the instance
  every_half_is_a_file: all three are real files embedded at build time rather than Go string literals, so a formatter, a linter, and an editor read them
  no_dependency_bytes: nothing here comes from the module any more, so an upgrade cannot change what a browser runs; what an upgrade can change is the wire, which the conformance harness is what catches
  order_is_load_bearing: boundary.js defines custom elements at module scope and the parser may upgrade one inside the define call, so it comes first and everything reachable at that moment is declared inside it; update.js installs nothing and the bootstrap builds the instance
  configuration_channel: an inert escaped meta element, because a module script has no way to read its own tag
composition:
  every_byte_is_this_frameworks: since 2026-08-04 the asset is boundary.js, update.js, and a bootstrap, with nothing from the dependency in it
  boundary_half: the apply core, the parser-path custom elements, the document end marker, truncation reload, and the live reader of api:live-delivery-protocol
  update_half: mode negotiation, manifest bookkeeping, delta application, head installation, redraw, action apply, link and GET-form interception, history, scroll, route-level focus, the announcement, the busy marker, supersession, form-state reconciliation, and preserved islands
  shared_core:
    what: one function carries client state from the outgoing nodes into a replacement, and both halves call it
    covers: preserved islands, per-control form-state restoration against each control's own default, and the file input that cannot be restored by value at all
    why_one: a delta swaps a region and a live delivery refills one, and a user who lost their typing would not care which did it; two implementations is what the merged asset used to be
    guarded_by: a test asserting the core is declared exactly once in the served bytes
  what_the_previous_composition_was:
    shape: the dependency's client concatenated above this framework's, with a factory the bootstrap called
    recorded_as: one apply function both halves call, which was never true; the module referenced neither exported apply function and swapped through its own
    also_duplicated: a live reader, a record stream consumer, and a reconnect policy, all speaking the token this framework defined
    why_it_could_not_be_fixed_in_place: the halves were concatenated text and the configuration reached the module as JSON from a meta element, so there was no channel an apply function could travel on
  written_against: the wire contract system:tinybind publishes rather than against its client, which is what makes this an implementation of a specification rather than a fork
  header_names: read from the configuration object the server builds, so a deployment that changes the prefix and a client that did not is impossible rather than silent
  instantiation: update.js exports a factory and installs nothing; the bootstrap builds the single instance and gives it this framework's name
conformance:
  harness: a node suite drives the update runtime against a stubbed page, covering the requests issued, the responses consumed, validator bookkeeping, supersession, head ordering, the terminator reasons, and every fallback path
  scope: the protocol half deliberately, since real DOM insertion is the browser's job and what this framework can be wrong about alone is the wire
  interception_is_protocol: which URL and which method a gesture turns into is decided here rather than by the browser, so the harness dispatches clicks and submits, per requirement:query-navigation-interception
  run_by: a Go test that skips when node is absent, so the toolchain is not a build dependency of a Go library
  parse_guard: the merged asset is parsed as a module, because a load-time throw leaves a page with no updates, no boundaries, and nothing in the console saying why
delivery:
  path: the revision-stamped reserved path of requirement:framework-script-assets, under the name popcornweb-runtime.js
  revision: a digest over the merged bytes, so an upstream upgrade that changes the runtime changes the URL with no constant to bump
  caching: public, max-age one year, immutable, which stays honest because a revision segment never serves different bytes
  form: an ES module referenced with type=module, so it defers by default and never blocks parsing
  no_inline: nothing is inlined on any path, so policy:security-response-headers can enforce script-src self with no nonce
bootstrap:
  tag: contributed by the framework at the render call, per decision:runtime-tag-injection, so no application file has to carry it and no shell edit can remove it
  url_stability: the framework builds the reference from its own revision, so nothing in any template names the URL and an upgrade moves it with no edit anywhere
  runtime_data: the endpoint prefix and the build identity travel as inert escaped head metadata on the same channel, never as inline script
  csrf_token: read from a cookie at the moment a request is issued rather than from the page, per requirement:module-native-csrf, so a rotation reaches an already-open screen
  capability_gating: gated on updates being enabled or the chain declaring an await or live block; decision:automatic-async-render-selection still decides only how to render, and injection is what makes not loading an option at all
  fragment_path: nothing is contributed, since decision:fragment-head-rejection means a fragment response has no head to merge into
client_state_preservation:
  unchanged_boundary: never touched, which is what makes focus, selection, and animation survive
  form_values: reconciled by comparing each control against its own default, so a user's typing survives an update that did not assert a new value, and a changed default wins
  ime: an update is deferred while a composition is active, on every path that applies one, per requirement:update-navigation-continuity
  caret: the focused control's selection is carried across a swap by the shared core, so a region that updates as it is typed keeps the cursor
  preserved_islands: a marked region has its live node moved into the replacement, for a third-party widget, a canvas, or a media element the server does not own
  file_input: not restorable by value at all, so it belongs in a preserved island or outside the region
  known_gap: a GET update cannot express clearing a form back to an unchanged default, because the markup is identical; post-redirect-get clears through an ordinary page load and is outside the rule
  scripting_off: none of this is needed, because a link, a GET form, and back all work by themselves; the runtime is an optimization of behavior the markup already has, which is what makes the fallback the absence of a code path rather than one more of them
failure_behavior:
  rule: every failure path performs the ordinary browser navigation to the same URL, so a user action is never lost
  no_javascript: links and forms work as they always have
  truncation: a streamed document reaching readyState complete with no end marker is reloaded once, with the guard that stops a server truncating every response from producing a reload loop
declaration_order:
  rule: every module-level binding is declared above the first customElements.define, since defining an element upgrades already-parsed ones synchronously inside the call
  guarded_by: a test over the script text, because the failure is a silent load-time throw invisible to every Go-level assertion
acceptance:
  - a strict CSP with no inline allowance applies every boundary, every delta, and every action response
  - one document loads exactly one framework script, whatever capabilities it uses
  - a change to any of the three files changes the served URL without editing the scaffolded shell
  - an unknown revision under the reserved path answers 404 rather than reaching the application
  - a completion whose bytes are split across chunks never destroys its fallback
  - typed text survives an update whose server-rendered default did not change
  - an application removing every script tag from its document shell still applies boundaries and still updates
  - the served bytes carry no dependency code, and the shared client-state core is declared exactly once
  - no application template and no served byte carries the dependency's name
open_questions:
  - whether the upstream half is fetched on demand as a capability module, keeping a static page at today's bytes, per the loading design of requirement:framework-script-assets
```
