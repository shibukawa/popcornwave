title: What The fasthttp Build Would Ask Of tinygodriver
---
A TinyGo build should need no extra tag. tinygodriver's fasthttp fork should select its zstd half on tinygo the way its own convention already says, and the encode-only path that makes that work is one pw already runs.

```yaml
status: delivered
delivered_by: tinygodriver v1.2.4, which took both asks at once — the fork encodes zstd through compress/zstd under TinyGo, so no tag is needed and the codec is kept rather than dropped
measured_after: a TinyGo fasthttp helloworld links with -tags fasthttp alone at 5.59 MiB and serves
serves: decision:tinygo-fasthttp-needs-nozstd
scope: this concept records what popcornweb would ask of tinygodriver; the work and the decision are tinygodriver's
already_provided_nothing_to_add:
  fasthttp_fork: a drop-in fasthttp whose patches are recorded in fasthttp/PATCHES.md
  fasthttp_nozstd: the tag that makes the TinyGo build link, already present and already measured there
  fasthttprouter: vendored, and popcornweb already imports it
  fasthttpwebsocket: a fasthttp/websocket fork whose server half needed no patches, which is the library requirement:contrib-websocket would build on when that work starts
first_ask_tag_the_split_on_tinygo:
  change: zstd.go takes "!fasthttp_nozstd && !tinygo" and zstd_disabled.go takes "fasthttp_nozstd || tinygo"
  effect: a TinyGo build links with no tag at all, which is what a user expects and what they meet a linker error instead of today
  it_is_the_repository_own_convention: tinygodriver's build-tag-selection rule, in its own catalog, already states std_path "!tinygo && !force_tinygo_logic" against native_path "(tinygo || force_tinygo_logic)", and names compress/zstd among its precedents
  precedent_in_this_repository: pw/response_zstd_tinygo.go and pw/response_zstd_std.go split on exactly that pair for exactly this dependency, which is why TinyGo links the net/http build today
  why_a_silent_drop_is_defensible_here: under TinyGo the current default does not build at all, so the choice is not zstd against no zstd but working against broken; a user who wants the codec can still pass noasm and pay 2.49 MiB
  not_absorbable_any_other_way: no module can force -tags noasm onto a dependency, so the importer declining the package is the only fix available below the build tool
the_second_ask:
  name: encode-only zstd for the fasthttp fork
  relation: this is what turns the first ask from "TinyGo loses zstd" into "TinyGo emits zstd for 0.08 MB"
  today_the_choice_is_binary:
    klauspost: 2.40 MB of TinyGo binary, encode and decode
    fasthttp_nozstd: 0 MB, no zstd at all, and a client offering only zstd is served identity
  proposed_middle: tinygodriver's own compress/zstd encoder at 0.08 MB, encode only
  why_it_fits_a_web_framework: a server compresses responses and rarely reads a compressed request body, so the decode half is what popcornweb pays for and does not use
  ratio_is_no_longer_the_objection: that encoder now fits FSE tables per block and codes literals, landing at 8.2% and 11.0% against deflate's 11.6% and 13.3%
  what_blocks_it:
    - compress/zstd excludes decoding, so BodyUnzstd, AppendUnzstdBytes and the FS pre-compressed .zst read have nothing to call
    - it offers no Reset and no compression levels, which are what fasthttp's per-level encoder pools are built on
  the_decode_half_already_has_a_landing_place: zstd_disabled.go returns ErrZstdUnsupported from everything whose signature carries an error, so an encode-only build is that file with its writers replaced rather than a new design
  and_the_decoder_is_the_whole_problem: both symbols TinyGo cannot link are decoder-side, per decision:tinygo-fasthttp-needs-nozstd, so dropping decode is not a side effect of this ask but the point of it
  recorded_upstream: tinygodriver fasthttp/PATCHES.md already names this as coherent to want and explicitly not what the tag does today, so this is a shared conclusion rather than a new proposal
smaller_asks:
  discoverability: the tag is documented in PATCHES.md, which is not where someone building a popcornweb app looks; naming it in the fasthttp README's TinyGo section would have saved the wrong conclusion recorded in decision:tinygo-fasthttp-needs-nozstd
  net_http_import: tinygodriver/fasthttp imports net/http, so a fasthttp binary still links it; whether that is separable is unmeasured here and may be load-bearing for the fork
acceptance:
  - a TinyGo fasthttp build can advertise zstd without linking klauspost
  - or the framework narrows its compression default and the ask is withdrawn
```
