title: Update Navigation Continuity
---
A navigation delta leaves the user where a document load would have left them: focus somewhere defined, scroll where the history entry says, a composition never cut off, and a request in flight visible — because a swap that keeps the live DOM also keeps everything a reparse would have reset, including what should have moved.

```yaml
source: decision:update-runtime-convergence
scope: what happens around an applied delta; requirement:query-navigation-interception is what starts one and requirement:navigation-delta-rendering is what the server sends
why_it_is_its_own_requirement: the delta was already correct while the page was still worse to use than the document path, and nothing about the wire explains that
the_test_for_each_rule:
  default: what the browser does on an ordinary document load is the answer, which is also the behavior a client with scripting off still gets for free
  deliberate_difference: a replaced navigation refines the page on screen, so leaving the viewport alone is chosen rather than inherited
as_built:
  focus:
    inside_a_replaced_region: the focused control is refocused by name after the replacement lands, with its selection offsets and direction restored
    where_it_lives: the shared client-state core of requirement:unified-update-runtime, so a delta, a redraw, an action response, and a live refill all carry it rather than one of them carrying it twice
    why_it_returns_a_callback: focusing a node still inside a fragment does nothing at all, silently, so the collection happens before insertion and the focusing after it
    across_a_route: a pushed navigation whose focus did not survive sends it to the page's main landmark, made programmatically focusable without entering the tab order
    concretely: a search box that updates as it is typed keeps its caret, which is the smallest example of this feature working and the one most likely to be built first
  announcement: a pushed navigation writes the new document title into a polite live region created at bootstrap, since a region created and filled in the same task is not reliably read
  scroll:
    recording: the entry being left is updated with its own position before the next is pushed, and it is read before the swap because afterwards the page is a different height and the position may already have clamped
    what_it_replaced: the outgoing position written onto the entry being pushed, which described the page being arrived at and left the entry a session opened on holding nothing
    browser_restoration: taken over, because it runs at popstate against the document still on screen, before the delta that makes the page that tall has arrived
    arriving: a pushed navigation starts at the top or at the fragment it named; a replaced one does not move; a pop restores what its entry recorded, after the content is back
  ime: applying is deferred while a composition is active and resumes when it ends, on the navigation, redraw, and action paths alike; every caller re-checks its ticket after waiting, so a response superseded during a composition is discarded exactly as one superseded at any other moment is
  pending: the document root carries a busy marker for the life of a navigation or a redraw, so a progress affordance is CSS an author writes once rather than a subscriber every application writes again
  marker_is_additive: nothing depends on it appearing, which is what keeps a page that never runs this script from needing a rule about it
conformance:
  covered: the two history writes and their order, the taken-over restoration, a pop writing no entry and restoring its recorded position, arriving at the top, focus moving to the landmark, focus that survived being left alone, the announcement, the busy marker while a request is open and after it settles, and a delta held back through a composition
  why_here: none of it is visible to a Go assertion, and all of it is what an author would otherwise discover from a bug report
acceptance:
  - typing in a search box that updates on input keeps the caret and the selection
  - back returns to the scroll position the user actually left
  - a link to another route arrives at the top of it
  - a composition in progress is never interrupted by a response
  - a screen reader is told the page changed
  - a request in flight is styleable with no application JavaScript
```
