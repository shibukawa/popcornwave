title: Component Output Cache
---
Replay a component's rendered bytes for equal declared parameters until its TTL expires, with the store, the reader identity, and the counters supplied by this framework.

```yaml
status: shipped; the annotation is system:tinybind's and everything it consults here is this framework's
saves: exactly what the component does and nothing above it; a hit replays stored bytes, so whatever the component would have executed is skipped and whatever its caller already executed is not
self_loading_component:
  since: system:tinybind v0.5.10, whose val binding names a synchronous external's result so a component reads one value instead of calling once per mention
  shape: the component declares the identifier as its parameter, binds the load in its body, and carries one annotation over the load and the render together
  why_it_needs_no_cache_work: the key is derived from the declared parameters, and a hit executes nothing, so the loader is skipped by the same mechanism that skips the markup; there is no second store and no key routing
  what_it_changes: this stops being a markup cache and becomes a fetch-and-render cache wherever an author writes it that way, which is the reading the owner intended from the start
  what_bounds_it:
    total_loader: a synchronous external has no error result, so the loader cannot report a failure; upstream tracks allowing one as an open question
    async_is_not_available: an async external needs an await boundary and a storing annotation is refused on any component reaching one, so the load blocks the render
    no_stale_policy: this cache has a TTL and neither a stale window nor invalidation, which is what requirement:data-result-cache carries and this does not
other_half: requirement:data-result-cache, which caches what a handler fetched; the two are alternatives for one page's data rather than layers, and the choice is stated on both guides
worth_it_when:
  markup_only: the markup is the expense — a long table, a rendered article, a tree walked into nested lists — and worth little when the database call is
  load_included: any time the component can load its own record, since the hit then saves the round trip rather than an escape pass; the same annotation one layer down is worth an order of magnitude more
division:
  upstream:
    - the annotation, its parsing, and every generation refusal below
    - key derivation, including the plan fingerprint
    - the CacheStore interface and the in-process MemoryCache behind it
  here:
    - the store instance, its configuration, and its lifetime
    - the reader identity a private key is prefixed with, per policy:component-cache-scope
    - the counters on the render span
    - the response header the same declaration decides, also policy:component-cache-scope
declaration:
  ttl_and_scope: stores, and states whose the output is
  ttl_alone: stores, and inherits private
  scope_alone: stores nothing and computes no key, so it may sit where storage cannot — an ordinary component, a layout, the document shell, a page that awaits
  neither: a generation error, since the annotation would ask for nothing
  ttl_on_a_layout_or_shell: a generation error for the mirror-image reason, since the duration would describe an expiry that cannot happen
key:
  parts: the component's package and file, a fingerprint of its generated plan, and every declared parameter
  fingerprint_buys: edited markup cannot be answered from entries the previous build wrote, including a change that came from a nested component rather than from the annotated template
  changed_parameter: a different key rather than a stale hit
  never_leaves_the_process: every parameter is framed in plaintext and nothing is hashed at run time, so a key carries parameter values and must not reach a browser
eligibility:
  applies_to: the storing form only, because every restriction protects stored bytes
  refused_at_generation:
    - an html parameter, since a slot argument is a bound continuation rather than a value
    - an async parameter, or a record reaching an async field
    - reaching an await boundary, directly or through a component it calls
    - owning the document head, since the merged head depends on the chain
    - reaching an unsafe form, which policy:csrf-protection records from the token's side
    - reaching a builtin element whose output comes from a provider, since a stored body would serve one request's value to whoever asks next
  reporting: each names the position of the declaration, and the component that made it ineligible when that is not the annotated one
store:
  lifetime: keyed on the configuration rather than built once, so disabling or resizing takes effect without a restart, and dropping the previous store is the eviction that change implies
  cold_start_race: two goroutines reaching a cold cache each build a store and one is dropped with whatever it collected, which costs a few repeated renders once per process and needs no lock on a path every response takes
  absent: a configuration that caches nothing passes no option, so a plan with nowhere to look renders normally and computes no key
configuration:
  section: html.cache of api:runtime-configuration, enabled and max_entries
  default: on, because the annotation is the opt-in — a project writing none never reaches this
  enabled_false: the switch for an operator who suspects a stale region and wants the question answered without a rebuild, not the switch that makes the annotation mean something
  sizing: the default suits keys holding one entry per parameter set; a private key holds one per parameter set per reader, and eviction is approximate insertion order, so a cap chosen for the shared case thrashes once a per-reader component joins it
  one_number: max_entries covers the whole process, which is why requirement:data-result-cache does not share this store
redraw: requirement:reloadable-component-endpoint renders through the page's own options and reaches the same store, so a component cached on the page stays cached in the response that replaces it
observability:
  attributes: pw.render.cache_hits and pw.render.cache_misses of data:framework-span-set
  why_both: a hit count alone cannot distinguish a working cache from one nothing is eligible for, and the annotation carries a TTL an author guessed with nothing else in the system saying whether the guess was right
  bound_once: the tally is attached to the store per response rather than looked up per component, so the context is walked once instead of once per cached subtree
  untraced: an untraced render leaves the store unwrapped and counts nothing
  writes_uncounted: a write follows the miss that was already counted, so counting it too would report every miss twice under a second name
  atomic: a cached component cannot own an await boundary but can sit under one, which htmlbind runs in its own goroutine
failure_modes:
  cache_nobody_hits: parameters that differ on every call compute a key and render into a buffer to store an entry no one reads; nothing about the response looks wrong, which is why both counters are reported
  private_on_an_anonymous_page: the same shape for the different reason that an anonymous render stores nothing
website: guides/frontend/rendering-cache and reference/template-syntax @cache carry this for readers
