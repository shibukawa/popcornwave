title: Firestore Code Generation
---
The entity codec, the key builder, and the declared queries of the Firestore store are generated from one Go declaration and one access-pattern file, so no call site builds a datastore.Value or names a property, a kind, or a client.

```yaml
audience: actor:application-developer
purpose:
  key: generate.firestore, a purpose of its own in data:project-config
  reads: Go sources carrying firestore struct tags, and the .pw.firestore query declarations beside them
  not_dynamo: generate.dynamo reads a different tag and a different declaration grammar, and a directory listed for one is not a generation source for the other
  not_queries: generate.queries reads .pw.sql; this reads Go type declarations and a grammar of its own
  optional_key: a project written before this existed has no key and no sources, so an absent key is the empty list
generated:
  codec: EncodeEntity and DecodeEntity over the firestore tags
  key_builder: EntityKey, from the name, id, and parent tags
  kind: Kind, defaulting to the Go type name
  version: EntityVersion, when a version tag is present, which makes a conditional write automatic
  expiry: ExpiryProperty, when a ttl tag is present
  queries: one function per declared access pattern, plus a Tx twin
  registration: an init calling api:firestore-package RegisterKind
what_the_key_model_changes:
  key_is_lifted_out: an identifier field carries no property name, because Datastore keeps identity beside the entity; writing it as a property too would store it twice and let the copies drift
  no_kind_argument: a kind belongs to the type, so an item call names none and a declaration has no counterpart to the .pw.dynamo table clause
  no_table_definition: nothing is emitted in place of a schema, per decision:firestore-no-schema-application
kind_registration:
  what: every generated kind registers itself from init, derived from the generated Kind method rather than from a second analysis
  why: the list a deployment applies TTL policies from is only knowable from the linked code, and an application kind carrying a ttl tag and missing from it is a policy nobody applies and records that never expire
  not_what_dynamo_registers_for: decision:dynamodb-table-registry feeds a migrator, and nothing here creates a kind; what this feeds is the published list
  every_kind_not_only_expiring_ones: so Kinds means kinds rather than kinds-that-need-a-policy; the cost is one init per bound type, which the DynamoDB store already accepted
usage_direction:
  same_as_dynamo: a call directs which half of a codec is emitted, exactly as requirement:dynamodb-generation states; a write directs the encoder and a read the decoder
  declaration_is_a_use_too: a declared query instantiates the binding with its result type, so a package whose only Firestore use is a declaration still gets the read half
  a_fixture_has_to_resolve_its_imports:
    found: 2026-08-05, while building the generation tests
    what: a package whose imports do not resolve has no discoverable call site at all, so a usage-directed run finds nothing to generate and the failure looks like a generator that ignores calls
    diagnosed_upstream: tinybind-go v0.3.7 reports the condition and names the fix instead of generating a partial codec, which is what turned a wrong conclusion here into a one-line fixture repair
    effect_on_the_tests: a fixture module requires what it imports at the versions this repository does, and resolves after its sources exist, since tidy prunes a requirement no file imports
scaffolding:
  directory: entities, listed in generate.firestore
  starter: one bound type carrying a name key, a noindex body, and a ttl property, and one declaration over it
  written_by: api:cli-init when Firestore is selected, and api:cli-add firestore into an existing project
declarations:
  extension: .pw.firestore, following the .pw. convention of every other declaration source rather than the module's own default
  names_no_kind: the result type names the Go type, and that type's Kind method is the kind, so a declaration cannot disagree with the codec about what it queries
  shapes: many, batch, count, and keys, matching what the binding returns
  composite_index: declared in the statement when a query needs one; nothing derives it, because the rule for when one is required is subtle and a derivation that is quietly wrong names an index that does not fix the query
  failure_mode: a query needing an index compiles and fails on its first run with FAILED_PRECONDITION, and nothing in the toolchain warns first, per decision:firestore-no-schema-application
acceptance:
  - a tagged struct in a generate.firestore directory produces a codec that round trips through system:tinygodriver-firestore without a call site naming a property
  - a declared query returns typed values without the caller naming a kind or a client
  - a scaffolded project that stores an entity and ranges over a declared query compiles
  - a ttl tag produces one generated fact and changes no stored bytes
  - every generated kind reaches api:firestore-package Kinds
  - a .pw.firestore file outside generate.firestore is reported as a stray source and is never parsed
  - a stored type gets an encoder and a type only read gets a decoder, from the call alone
non_goals:
  - deriving which composite index a query needs
  - emitting an index.yaml, which is project-wide and hand-edited
  - a fluent query builder; the declaration is the answer
  - generating for the framework's own stores, which are handwritten because one package is their only reader and writer
