title: A Distributed Component Must Carry Its Own Assets
---
A component published in a module must declare the script and style it needs and let the caller decide where they are served, because the package owns no route and the consumer's document shell cannot name a file it has never seen.

```yaml
owner: system:tinybind
status: designed upstream and unbuilt; the upstream component asset requirement was accepted on 2026-07-31 with the library case left as an open question, and this is that question answered yes
priority: should
depends_on: requirement:cross-package-components, because a component the consumer cannot call needs no asset path
what_exists_upstream:
  authoring_case: a component's inline style and script are extracted into content-hashed files under a configured public directory, and the reference tag is merged into the head
  library_case_open: that path serves a component declared in a template file of the generation unit being compiled, and the written file is a filesystem artifact
  designed: an embedded asset table in generated Go, a static required set on the render plan, and a caller-supplied URL function, none of it built
  open_question_verbatim: whether a cross-package template component reaches this seam at all
what_this_framework_needs:
  embedded_table: the asset bytes, digest, and media type in generated Go rather than in written files, because requirement:package-asset-delivery serves from embedded bytes and a TinyGo target may have no filesystem
  url_function: the framework supplies the reference URL, because only it knows the reserved prefix and the digest path; the package must not choose one
  static_required_set: readable before rendering starts, because a requirement:html-fragment-rendering response and a live delivery can both insert a component whose script was not in the first render
  fragment_path_report: a response with no document shell must report an asset it cannot deliver, matching how a fragment response already refuses head contributions
why_it_matters_here:
  - without it the application writes one tag per package in its document shell, which works for two packages and not for ten
  - a component added by a package upgrade reaches no existing project, because the shell is a file the application owns
  - requirement:package-asset-delivery serves the file either way; what is missing is the component saying it needs one
interim:
  what: the package documents its asset name, the application writes the tag, and requirement:package-asset-delivery resolves the URL
  honest_limit: it does not scale, and it silently breaks when a package upgrade adds an asset
acceptance:
  - a component in an imported module contributes its script reference to the consumer's head with no application edit
  - three components requiring one asset emit one tag
  - the required set is readable before rendering, so a fragment swap needs no mid-swap fetch
  - a project using no such component regenerates byte-identical output
