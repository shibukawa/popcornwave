title: WebSocket In contrib, Withdrawn
---
The plan to reach WebSocket through an external client in contrib is withdrawn; requirement:typed-websocket carries the capability, from pw and pwfast over the module's own typed socket.

```yaml
status: withdrawn 2026-08-11, not built
superseded_by: requirement:typed-websocket
kept_rather_than_deleted: it is cited by decision:transport-handle-containment, requirement:proxied-request-identity and requirement:second-build-feature-parity, and the reasoning that moved is worth more than the file it sat in
what_it_proposed_2026_08_08:
  package: github.com/shibukawa/popcornwave/contrib/websocket
  client: github.com/fasthttp/websocket v1.5.12, added to the module graph of every project
  surface: "Upgrade(w, r, func(*websocket.Conn) error) error, handing the library's own Conn to the callback with no facade"
  premise: no dependency then in the graph could complete an upgrade on either backend
why_each_clause_lapsed:
  premise: system:tinybind v0.5.7 ships the typed socket on both transports over system:tinygodriver v1.2.3, both already required, per system:tinybind-websocket
  dependency_cost: void; the clause weighing fasthttp appearing in a net/http-only project's go.mod describes a dependency that is no longer added
  tinygo_matrix: void; the risk was the unverified dependency chain, and the driver packages are written to build under TinyGo
  no_facade: reversed; the callback receives a typed Socket whose Read and Write are generated, and that typing is the capability rather than a wrapper around one
  placement: contrib cannot satisfy requirement:pw-call-registration, whose rewrite moves an import qualifier and nothing else
what_survived_intact:
  origin_check_ownership: the reasoning that an upgrade carries cookies, never meets the CSRF middleware, and must not be left on a library default; it is now decision:websocket-origin-check-owner
  proxy_precondition: that the check needs requirement:proxied-request-identity first, which was the stated blocker and has since shipped
  boundaries: no frame protocol, no hub, no rooms, no broadcast facade, and no reconnection or delivery guarantees
  lifetime: the callback closes over what it needs and never over the transport value, per rule:transport-handle-checks
```
