title: Preset and Customization Documentation
---
The documentation names every requirement:init-presets preset, says which project each is for, and shows how to move a project off the answer its preset gave, so a preset is a starting point a reader can leave rather than a shape they are stuck inside.

```yaml
audience: actor:application-developer
house_style: the documentation skill of this repository owns voice, structure, and the link and parity checks
pages:
  preset_reference:
    where: the api:cli-init page, pw/project/init
    holds:
      - the preset list, each with the project it is for and the answers that distinguish it
      - what every preset answers the same way, so a reader knows what the choice is not about
      - the --preset flag and its conflict with the capability flags
      - that Manual is the decision:navigable-answer-hub, and that a preset's review is that same hub
    replaces: nothing; the per-option table stays, because it documents the questions a preset answers
  customization_guide:
    where: a page of its own beside the api:cli-init page, pw/project/presets
    opens_with: a preset is ten answers with a name, and every answer is still an answer
    holds:
      - which changes are one api:cli-add away, per requirement:incremental-project-capabilities
      - which changes are an edit, and what the edit is
      - which changes are neither, and what to do instead of trying
    depth_rule: the guide names the change and links the page that owns it, rather than restating that page
worked_cases:
  rule: two or three cases in full, not one per answer
  rdb_engine:
    why_first: the reader who asked for this guide asked about this case, and it is the answer that touches the most files
    from: the sqlite the website-login preset gives
    to: postgres or mysql, per requirement:database-engine-selection
    steps: the project.database key, the rdb DSN of rule:rdb-dsn-resolution, the driver blank import, the dialect of the migration and the .pw.sql sources, and the development server
    two_more_with_a_login:
      framework_migrations: the rule:framework-owned-tables files are in the old dialect and no command re-emits them, so the guide gives the procedure that works — scaffold a throwaway project on the target engine with the same answers and copy its files across
      auth_state_import: authstate is one package per engine, so the blank import changes with the DSN
      found_by: performing the switch on a scaffolded login project, which built only after both
    honest_about: decision:server-sql-support-tier translates nothing between dialects, so a project with hand-written SQL rewrites it
    cheapest_moment: before the first migration runs anywhere, which is worth saying where a reader can still act on it
    presentation: requirement:engine-parameterized-docs tabs, since every step above differs by engine
  session_backend:
    from: the redis the website-login preset gives
    to: rdb or cookie
    steps: session.backend, the api:session-backend-plugin blank import, the framework-owned migration for a backend that has one, and the Valkey package the preset added
    honest_about: every backend reads the same in a handler, so this is a deployment change and not an application one
  adding_a_login:
    from: either simple website preset
    command: pw add auth
    honest_about: it takes the database with it, because plugin/auth keeps its ceremony records and its allowlist in SQL
  the_router:
    from: either simple website preset to the other
    command: pw add registered or pw add discovered, which install the router the project lacks rather than replace the one it has
    honest_about: decision:dual-router-coexistence means a project ends up with both trees, and removing the first one is a manual deletion
  finishing_the_api_server:
    from: the api-server preset, which requirement:api-server-scaffold points at a development issuer nobody runs
    steps: replace auth.jwt.issuer and auth.jwt.audience, turn allow_loopback_http back off, choose the policy:bearer-admission mode the deployment wants, and drop the config.dev.toml relaxation once a real authorization server exists
    also: enabling policy:token-revocation, which is pw add database plus the popcornweb_revoked_token migration and the revocation keys
    honest_about: the project runs immediately and deploys nowhere, and the reader does not have to remember to remove the relaxation because a non-development build and a non-development environment each refuse it
    token_shape: the hand-written token needs iss as well as sub, because the account is derived from the pair
    names_the_mode: this is where requirement:jwt-only-api-authentication is documented, per decision:jwt-only-mode-not-scaffolded putting it in the API-server reference and not in the tutorial
  the_package_kind:
    from: nothing; a package project and an application project are not convertible in either direction
    says: the tracked generated Go of decision:committed-package-artifacts, the missing entry point, and the missing environment configuration are the project kind rather than answers
    instead: create the other kind and move the sources, which is cheaper than converting either way
what_cannot_be_changed:
  toolchain: the TinyGo answer, which api:cli-add cannot revisit; the api:cli-init page already carries this and the guide links it
  form: one short section naming the answer and its existing page, not a repeat of it
when_not_to_use:
  rule: the guide says when reaching for it is the wrong move
  case: a project that wants three of the four changes above was created from the wrong preset, and creating a second project is cheaper than converting the first
localization: English and Japanese, both carrying the same cases in the same order
acceptance:
  - every preset in requirement:init-presets appears on the api:cli-init page with the project it is for
  - the engine case names every file that changes, in each of the three dialects
  - a reader following the engine case reaches a project that runs its migrations and serves its queries
  - the guide links rather than restates the storage, session, and authentication pages
  - a preset absent from the list is absent from the documentation, and none is absent today
non_goals:
  - a section per answer, which is the option table again
  - a migration tool that performs any of these changes
  - documenting a change into a shape api:cli-init cannot produce
```
