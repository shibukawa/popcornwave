title: Typed Server Action
---
A declared Go function of any signature becomes a server action a component script calls by name, with its arguments bound from the call and its result encoded, so the shape a script reaches is typed at both ends where the shape a form reaches cannot be.

```yaml
source: the user's declaration proposal 2026-08-13, which supplies the mechanism the typed rung of api:server-action has been recorded as needing
rung: api:server-action, whose typed argument binding this is; api:page-action-endpoint stays exactly as it is and is what a form reaches
shape:
  authored: |
    var _ = pw.ServerAction(GetUser)

    func GetUser(id string) (User, error) { … }
  declaration_is_required: an arbitrary signature carries nothing that says it is an action, which is the whole difference from the raw shape
  go_syntax: a package-level call expression is not legal Go, so the declaration is an assignment to the blank identifier or a call inside init
  results: one value and an error, or an error alone
why_it_is_a_second_shape_rather_than_a_replacement:
  the_raw_one_is_load_bearing: a form action legitimately answers with a redirect, a conditional status, a download, or a stream, and no fixed return covers those
  so: requirement:scriptless-action-forms keeps the raw handler, and this is what a caller holding the answer reaches
  one_page_may_have_both: they are different functions with different signatures, and the address of each is the same hash of directory and name
admission:
  today: rule is the signature; routetree admits an exported function taking exactly the transport types and returning nothing, and anything else is ordinary code
  with_this: a declaration admits a function the signature filter would refuse, so the two rules coexist rather than one replacing the other
  why_not_widen_the_filter_instead: a shape rule over arbitrary signatures cannot exist, since every exported function has one; something has to say which are actions
  decided_in: decision:typed-action-declaration
arguments:
  bound_by_name: each parameter takes the member of the call's payload with its name, which is the rule flow:page-route-generation already applies to a page entry point against the URL
  source: the caller alone, because the direct endpoint of api:page-action-endpoint holds no path parameter; there is no second place for one to come from and therefore no precedence rule to state
  encoding: the JSON body requirement:action-invocation-runtime already sends, read into the generated argument struct through api:request-binding
  a_parameterless_action: legal, and called with no argument at all
results:
  value: encoded through api:api-response, which is what makes it a value the caller reads rather than markup it would have to apply
  error: api:problem-response through the framework error path, so a failure is the shape every other typed entry produces
  no_regions: a typed action never answers with the update regions requirement:action-response-update carries; a handler needing those is the raw shape, and mixing them would put the result question back where this design just answered it
  decided_in: decision:typed-action-is-call-only
signature_is_read_syntactically:
  fact: routetree already reads a page entry point's parameters and results from the AST rather than from type information, because generation runs before the package it analyzes can compile
  consequence: a parameter type is a name, which is all the generated glue needs — it constructs the argument struct and encodes the result, and neither step reads the type's fields
  therefore: this needs no type-checking pass and introduces no ordering problem
what_generation_emits:
  registration: the direct endpoint, as today
  glue: decode the payload, call the function, write the value or the problem
  where_the_line_moves: this is the first action generation that writes into the response, which every earlier decision in this feature kept out; the page entry point of concept:page-tree already crosses it, so the line moves rather than breaking
checks:
  unresolvable_declaration: a declaration naming something that is not a function in this package fails generation
  unencodable: a parameter or result type the codec cannot carry fails generation, naming the type and the position
  collision: a typed and a raw action of the same name in one package is the hash collision api:page-action-endpoint already refuses
  reachable_from_a_template: a typed action named by server-action is a generation error, because a form reaching it would be shown a value it cannot render
security:
  unchanged: the address grants nothing, so the function authenticates and authorizes its own caller exactly as rule:server-action-authoring requires of the raw shape
  narrower_in_one_way: nothing is published by merely existing, since a declaration is what admits one; the reachable-surface cost api:page-action-endpoint accepts does not apply here
  csrf: policy:csrf-protection over the prefix, unchanged; the call carries the token on the header the runtime already sends
ownership:
  upstream: admitting the second shape, reading the declaration, and emitting the glue, all of which are routetree's
  this_framework: the declaration's spelling, the actions namespace that calls it, and the runtime that already sends the payload and reads the answer
  what_already_exists_here: requirement:action-invocation-runtime posts JSON and returns a non-update response to its caller, so a typed action needs nothing new on the client at all
the_request_is_written: docs/tinybind-go-typed-action-request.md, which states the five asks, their inputs and outputs, the non-asks, and the one line this feature moves — that generation writes a response body, which the page entry point already does
shipped_upstream_2026_08_14:
  version: system:tinybind v0.5.10, which built asks 1 to 5 of the request
  answered_as_asked: the annotation takes the symbol and an optional published name, the declaration is matched against the file's own imports, a leading context is trimmed on the terms the typed page entry point already had, and the published name derives initialism-aware with the string overriding it
  one_thing_it_added: the published name is on every action rather than only a typed one, so a raw action is called as rename where its address still carries Rename; this framework read the Go name and now reads Published
  wrapper_rather_than_the_function: the registration names the generated entry point, so a declared function may stay unexported and the lower-case opt-out stops meaning anything under a declaration
  wired_here: pw.ServerAction, the declaration on both transports' handler shapes, and the per-package hand-off from routetree Result.Actions to the binding phase
  the_identifier_had_to_be_stated: a path's last element is not the package name for either module — tinybind-go is httpbind and popcornwave is pw — which is why the module made it a declared field
  two_defects_stopped_it_compiling:
    where: docs/tinybind-go-typed-action-wiring-report.md, measured by declaring one in the page tree fixture
    split_artifact: the argument struct is analysed with an empty source path while the wrapper is emitted into every per-source artifact, so the decoder the wrapper names lands in a different file; the encode half reaches the right one, so only decoding is missing
    rediscovery: the wrapper is an exported handler-shaped function in a route package, and the generated-source filter names this framework's own header while the wrapper carries the module's, so the next run publishes the wrapper as a raw action with its own hash and published name
    neither_is_reachable_from_the_module_s_tests: both need a package emitting more than one artifact, and its own test emits with no selection
    not_worked_around: naming another module's header string to avoid rediscovering its output goes stale silently and would exclude a hand-written file headed the same way
    answered_in: v0.5.14, below
answered_upstream_2026_08_16:
  version: system:tinybind v0.5.14, which fixed both defects on the terms the report asked for and neither by a workaround
  split_artifact: the action carries the file it was declared in, the argument struct takes that source path, and the artifact loop scopes which actions each artifact writes rather than the emitter filtering a list it cannot place
  two_cases_the_fix_had_to_carry:
    no_parameter: an action declaring none contributes no type, so the artifact loop seeds a source from the action list or its entry point would be written nowhere
    path_spellings: routetree reports the file as it walked it and the plan carries what the loader reported, so the match is on the base name, which is unambiguous because a package is one directory
  rediscovery: action discovery now skips a file it recognizes as generated, which the rule system:tinybind states for route discovery and the call-site analysis and which this pass had never implemented; the module's own header is recognized unprompted, so no caller names another module's prefix to skip that module's output
  a_parse_mode_hid_it: the skip was added and did nothing, because ParseFile was called without ParseComments and the header is a comment
  the_third_pass_to_meet_that_rule: after route discovery and the transform, which is the same lesson each time — a pass reading the package reads its own output back
  what_stayed_this_framework_s: HandlerShape.GeneratedHeaders, where a framework registers the header it brands its own output with; the module's test names this framework's prefix, which is what says the registration was left here deliberately
as_built_2026_08_16:
  admission_is_one_function_now: setActionAdmission states both rules for one transport — the annotation that admits a declared function, and the header whose files are not read — and both emitters call it, so the two trees cannot drift on either
  registered_defensively: no file this framework generates declares a handler-shaped exported function today, so nothing was being rediscovered; the registration is for the same reason options.GeneratedHeaders exists, and costs one line
  fixture: the route package declares profile, unexported, taking a leading context and returning a value and an error, beside the two raw handlers it already had
  what_the_fixture_proves:
    it_compiles: the decoder and the entry point are in one artifact, which is defect one
    the_second_run_is_a_no_op: regenerating publishes no wrapper of its own, which is defect two, and the committed-artifact test is what asserts it
    the_value_comes_back: a POST carrying {"id":"42"} answers 200 with both fields, so the argument bound by name and the result encoded are both real
    one_namespace: the typed action is published beside the two raw ones on the same route, so a script sees three names and not two surfaces
  unexported_is_the_visible_difference: the declaration publishes it, so the export rule that admits a raw handler means nothing here, and the fixture spells that out by declaring a lower-case function
  documentation: the server actions guide gained the typed shape as its own section, both locales, and lost a paragraph explaining the absence against a Load that no longer exists
acceptance:
  - a declared function of any signature is reachable at its own endpoint and callable by name from a component script
  - its arguments arrive from the caller's payload by name, and its value comes back as a value rather than as markup
  - an error becomes a problem response with the status the framework already maps
  - an undeclared function of a non-handler shape is ordinary code, reachable at no address
  - a typed action named from a template fails generation
  - a project declaring none regenerates byte-identical output
context:
  decided: 2026-08-13, a leading context.Context is accepted and optional
  why_it_is_not_a_luxury: this framework puts the database handle and the authenticated session on the request context per api:request-context-accessors, so a function reading either needs one, and most functions worth declaring read one
  which_context: the request's, so a cancelled request cancels the query it started
  position: leading only; a context anywhere else keeps the ordinary not-an-input diagnostic, which is the right answer there
  optional: a function needing none declares none, so nothing is imposed on the simple case
  costs_nothing_to_build: routetree already detects a leading context syntactically for a typed page entry point and already passes the request's, so a typed action reuses the detection rather than asking for one
the_identity_comes_from_the_symbol:
  decided: 2026-08-13
  form: the declaration takes the function, and generation reads which function it is from the symbol it was handed
  rejected_for_identity: a string naming the function, which would put the same fact in two places and make a rename a thing to remember rather than a thing the compiler does
  what_the_symbol_buys: a declaration naming a function that does not exist fails to compile before generation ever reads it
  consequence_for_the_address: renaming the Go function changes the hash and therefore the address, exactly as it does for the raw shape, so nothing new is true about deployment
the_published_name_is_a_separate_axis:
  asked: 2026-08-13, because a script writing actions.GetUser reads wrong in a language whose convention is camelCase, and Go's export rule leaves no choice about the identifier
  why_it_is_not_the_question_answered_above: that one is which function this is, and this one is what callers call it; the first has one true answer and the second is a name published to somebody else
  precedent: a struct tag declares a wire name rather than deriving one from the Go field, for the reason that applies here — a published name is a contract with a caller and should not churn when an identifier is renamed for reasons the caller cannot see
  default: the Go name in lowerCamelCase, so GetUser is called as getUser and the common case needs nothing written
  derivation: lowercase the leading run of capitals, leaving the last of the run intact when a lowercase letter follows it, which reads GetUser as getUser, GetURL as getURL, URLFor as urlFor, and ID as id
  override: an optional string on the declaration, for a name the derivation reads wrong and for a published name a Go rename must not move
  why_optional_rather_than_required: requiring it would put a string beside every action to restate what the derivation already gets right, which is the boilerplate the raw shape is free of
  what_it_does_not_change: the address, which stays the hash of the directory and the Go name, so the published name is what a script writes and never what a request carries
  the_call_site_is_the_unchecked_half:
    fact: a script writes actions.GetUser, which is a string naming a Go function, and renaming the function leaves it naming nothing
    contrast: every other reference this feature added is checked — server-action against the route package, an on-attribute against the block's returned names — and this one is not
    why_it_is_not_a_reason_to_carry_a_name_instead: a declared string would be checked against the function and the script would still name it by string, so the unchecked hop moves rather than closing
    what_would_close_it: reading actions.X member expressions in the block, which decision:component-handler-namespace already records as deeper than the declarations the scanner reads and worth having rather than blocking on
    until_then: an unknown name is undefined at the call site, and the runtime reports what the route does publish
where_the_declaration_sits:
  recommended: the file declaring the function, so a reader meeting the function learns it is published without opening another file
  not_enforced: generation reads the whole route package, so a project collecting its declarations elsewhere still generates
  why_recommendation_rather_than_rule: the argument for a central list is that it makes the surface readable at a glance, and the generated route table already answers that better than a hand-kept file could
  worth_a_check_later: a declaration far from its function is the shape that goes stale, and reporting it is cheap once anything is reading declarations at all
```
