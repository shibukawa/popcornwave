title: Module Native CSRF
---
system:tinybind v0.3.3 puts the CSRF token in every unsafe form itself, so a template author writes nothing, the value never enters template scope, and what this framework owns narrows to the secret, its lifecycle, and the middleware that checks it.

```yaml
supersedes: the framework-supplied csrf-token element this catalog planned, and the interim external returning html that stood in for it; neither is built and neither is needed
why_it_moved: an author forgetting a hidden field is a form that silently stops working the moment protection is enabled, and no framework seam placed above the template can catch that
what_the_module_does:
  insertion: a hidden field as the first child of every unsafe form, meaning post, put, patch, and delete
  authoring_cost: none; there is no element to write, no import, and no declaration
  scope_containment: the value is never bound to a name, so no template can interpolate it into a URL, an attribute, or a log line
  one_call_per_render: the token is produced at most once and every occurrence shares it, so the hidden field and the header cannot disagree by construction rather than by this framework's care
  header: the merged runtime attaches it to every request it issues
  verification: a module entry reads the header first, then the body, and compares in constant time
token_supply:
  channel: a render option carrying the token, not the request context, because htmlbind holds no context keys and could not read one
  where_pw_supplies_it: the page and streaming render entries, reading the value through api:request-context-accessors
  not_in_the_shared_option_builder: the fragment path shares that builder and renders no document, so the option is added above it exactly as decision:runtime-tag-injection adds the runtime tag
  sessionless: this framework supplies no option at all, so an unsafe form fails the render
  correction: an earlier revision here said to pass the module's explicit no-token option; reading it showed that option renders the field with an empty value rather than failing, which the module documents for a render that is not a response such as a mail body, a static export, or a golden test
  why_that_matters: using it on the HTTP path would put an unprotected form on screen and say nothing, which is the failure this whole capability exists to prevent
  missing: an unsafe form with no token supplied fails the render, because an empty field would submit, be rejected, and leave nothing pointing at the cause
generation_refusals:
  get_form: no token, since a GET form's fields become the query string and a token there reaches history, logs, and referrers
  static_cross_origin_action: a generation error, because it would hand the session's secret to a third party
  dynamic_method: a generation error, because an undecidable method either leaks the token to a GET or leaves the form unprotected
  existing_field_of_the_same_name: left alone, so a project migrating from a hand-written token is not broken
what_this_framework_still_owns:
  secret_and_delivery: requirement:csrf-token-lifecycle, which mints the value with the session, keeps it in data:session-record, and carries it on the cookie, the header, and the render
  middleware: the path scoping, the origin check, the 403 through api:error-renderer, and the exclusions; none of this moved
  configuration: the field and header names, kept at the module defaults unless a project has a reason
runtime_token_transport:
  module_default: the token travels in the runtime configuration on the script tag, which is written once at render
  consequence: a page held open across a rotation holds a stale token and its next action is refused
  this_framework_deviates: the shipped runtime reads the token from a cookie at the moment a request is issued, so a rotation reaches an open page through an ordinary set-cookie
  built: in the boundary runtime that already exists, which issues a credentialed request for the live delivery stream; the merged asset of requirement:unified-update-runtime inherits the same helper rather than introducing it
  prior_art: Django, Laravel, and Spring's SPA configuration all read at request time rather than from something embedded in the page
  unchanged_either_way: a form rendered before a rotation is refused after it, which is a security boundary working
caching_constraint:
  rule: a component containing an unsafe form cannot be output-cached, and the check walks the call graph
  why: a stored body would hand one session's token to the next visitor
  shape_it_pushes: split the cacheable list from the form that carries the token, and compose both in the page
  escape: turning the module's CSRF mode off removes the constraint, for a deployment that decided on origin checks alone
as_built:
  where: the option is added in the one document render entry every page branch funnels through, so the buffered, streaming, and live paths all carry it and the fragment path does not
  precedence: framework first, caller last, so an application option still wins
  proved_by: a page with a form emits a token that verifies against the session secret, two responses emit different bytes, a sessionless render fails rather than emitting an empty field, and a page with no form is byte-identical with and without a session
acceptance:
  - a template author writes nothing and every unsafe form posts successfully
  - the token never appears in template scope, a URL, or a log line
  - the hidden field and the header always carry the same value within one render
  - a GET form carries no token
  - a cross-origin or dynamic-method form fails generation, naming the file, line, and column
  - a component with an unsafe form inside a cached one fails generation
  - a render with no token supplied fails rather than emitting an empty field
  - a rotated token reaches an already-open page through the cookie transport
  - a project with no unsafe form regenerates byte-identical output
```
