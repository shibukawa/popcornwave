title: Human Presence Signal
---
Idle expiry is driven by HTTP requests, which are a proxy for human presence that fails in both directions, so a browser reports interaction and absence instead.

```yaml
status: implemented, off by default
implemented:
  config: the auth.assurance.presence prefix, refusing an absent_after that a single missed tick would close
  endpoint: POST and same-origin under the logout path, bounded to a small body, accepting one boolean and an optional clock gap
  absence: a false report, or a clock gap at least as large as absent_after, ends the session
  presence: nothing is written, because the request already refreshed idle expiry through the session middleware within the absolute bound it also enforces, so reporting presence cannot extend a session further than an ordinary request would
  browser: api:cli-init writes public/presence.js, which sets one flag from passive listeners and clears it each tick
  wanted_first_by: policy:shared-device-mode, and useful to every deployment
today:
  mechanism: the session manager touches the record on any request once past the renewal interval, per flow:session-lifecycle
  meaning: idle expiry measures time since the last HTTP request, not time since a person did anything
false_extension:
  case: a page holding a live connection reconnects on its own schedule, and every reconnect is a request that touches the session
  concrete: requirement:live-html-rendering reconnects a client roughly every ten minutes at the default lifetime, so a thirty-minute idle timeout is never reached by an abandoned page
  effect: an unattended browser keeps a session alive indefinitely, which is exactly what policy:shared-device-mode most needs bounded
  present_not_future: this follows from two shipped features and is observable today
false_expiry:
  case: a person reading or composing on one page for longer than the idle timeout issues no request
  effect: the session ends mid-work, and the deployment answers by lengthening the timeout, which weakens it for the abandoned case too
  consequence: one number is being asked to serve presence and absence at once, and cannot
signal:
  question: whether any input occurred, not what the input was
  mechanism:
    - passive listeners on pointer, key, scroll, wheel, touch, and visibility set one flag
    - a periodic tick sends that flag and clears it
    - the wire carries one bit per tick and nothing else
  absence: the flag reporting false for a configured number of consecutive ticks is the absence report
  not_wanted: page views, which a reader does not generate and a background reconnect does
  why_one_bit:
    - no coordinate, no key, no timing, and no interval leaves the browser, so the biometrics non-goal below becomes impossible rather than merely forbidden
    - the transmitted claim is the negation of absence, which is the direction trust_asymmetry already treats as bounded, so the untrusted channel carries the least it can
    - a boolean set by a listener that returns early once set costs nothing on a high-frequency event such as pointermove
  blind_spots:
    embedded_focus: input inside an iframe or a plugin may not reach the top document, so a page composed of them needs its own report
    passive_attention: watching a video or reading fullscreen produces no input while a person is present, and a page that knows this asserts activity explicitly, bounded exactly as any other presence claim is
  sleep_and_resume:
    no_direct_api: nothing reports a machine waking, so it is inferred
    inference: a timer that should fire on a fixed interval observing a wall-clock gap far larger than that interval
    supplements: the Page Lifecycle freeze and resume events, and visibilitychange
    treatment: a detected gap is an absence report, not a reason to extend anything
trust_asymmetry:
  principle: a claim of absence is actionable and a claim of presence is not, because their failure costs are not symmetric
  absence_claimed: acted on immediately, since a false positive costs one extra sign-in
  absence_observed: a beacon that stops arriving is itself an absence report, because a client cannot assert not-being-there
  presence_claimed: bounded, since a script can send it; it may refresh idle expiry within the server's bounds and may never move the absolute expiry
  authority: the server remains authoritative for every lifetime, and the signal is an input to a bound it already owns
required:
  - a browser reports interaction and inferred absence to an endpoint the framework mounts
  - a presence report refreshes idle expiry only, and never beyond the absolute expiry of policy:session-security
  - an absence report ends the session, or downgrades it under policy:session-downgrade, without waiting for the idle timeout
  - a live connection stops counting as activity, so reconnection and presence become different facts
  - the endpoint is bounded by the identity bucket of requirement:rate-limit-enforcement rather than by a rule of its own, so the tick interval is part of what sizes that limit, and accepts one bit per tick with no room for a description of the input
  - a client that sends nothing degrades to today's request-driven behavior rather than to an unbounded session
non_goals:
  - behavioral biometrics, keystroke dynamics, or anything identifying a person from how they interact, which the one-bit wire cannot express
  - recording which elements were interacted with, which is analytics rather than session lifetime
  - treating the signal as authentication, which it never is
  - inferring anything about the person from the pattern of ticks beyond present or absent
```
