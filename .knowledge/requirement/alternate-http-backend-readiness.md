title: Readiness For A Non-net/http Backend
---
Adding a second HTTP backend must stay a framework-sized change: paid once inside pw and the generated-code templates, never once per application handler.

```yaml
status: proposed
not_a_commitment:
  planned: no fasthttp backend is scheduled for a release
  committed: keeping the option cheap, because losing it is paid silently over every handler written meanwhile, while keeping it is one rule
  published_position: the why-popcorn-wave page says fasthttp is a different boundary and this framework will not sit under a net/http-shaped compatibility layer; readiness does not contradict it, because this is about what application code names, not about shipping an adapter
what_a_swap_actually_costs:
  handler_shape: fasthttp dispatches func(*fasthttp.RequestCtx), one value carrying both directions, so a two-parameter net/http handler has no shape-preserving translation
  context: '*fasthttp.RequestCtx implements context.Context itself, so nothing wraps it and r.Context() has no counterpart there'
  lifetime: that value and everything reachable from it are pooled and invalid once the handler returns, which net/http never required and application code therefore does not respect today
  adapter: an adaptor converts a net/http handler by materializing the net/http values the backend exists to avoid allocating, so it answers compatibility and not the reason anyone switches
all_or_nothing_now:
  fact: decision:transport-compatibility-fallback records the reversal; there is no adapter, and a function the rewriter refuses fails the build
  effect: this requirement stopped being about keeping an option cheap and became the precondition for the option existing at all
  visible_before_committing: the upstream report-only run lists every refusal without generating, so the whole cost is knowable in advance rather than discovered during a migration
why_the_rule_pays_regardless:
  - decision:wasi-http-deferred already names this property as its future boundary, and a component-model host is the likelier payoff than fasthttp
  - a handler naming the transport only through pw is the handler api:cli-generate can analyze, per requirement:httpbinder-extensible-route-analysis
  - containment is testable now; a backend port is not
mechanism: decision:transport-handle-containment
acceptance:
  - every transport-typed call shape reachable from application code is enumerable from the pw surface
  - scaffolds from api:cli-init, the examples, and the tutorial name w and r only at that surface
  - a hypothetical backend changes pw, pwruntime, middlewares, and the generated-code templates, and no application file, except the application's own middleware, which decision:backend-specific-middleware never promised
  - the upstream report-only run over every scaffold, example, and tutorial package reports nothing
largest_item: the full framework middleware set, ported per backend rather than adapted, per decision:backend-specific-middleware
prerequisites:
  surveyed: 2026-08-09, against tinybind-go v0.4.10
  already_neutral:
    htmlbind: every render entry point takes io.Writer, so the heaviest upstream dependency needed no port; what is net/http-shaped is the negotiation, status, header, compression, and flush layer around it, which is pw's own code
    jsonbind: an append-to-bytes API with no HTTP in it
    sqlbind, configbind, minitoml, cliparser, dynamobind, firestorebind: no HTTP
    internal path grammar: string matching, shared by the path-scoped policies
  upstream_status: requirement:tinybind-alternate-backend-support, which records what shipped and what is left
  router:
    default: the tinygodriver fasthttprouter fork, not the upstream one, and the reason is a type identity rather than a preference
    why: the upstream router takes valyala fasthttp's request value, while the TinyGo fork vendors its own, so a handler built against the fork is not the type that router accepts; upstream vendored the router beside the fork instead of giving up the TinyGo build
    configurable: a router target names the import, qualifier, type, registration function, and catch-all spelling, so an application on upstream fasthttp points it at the upstream router and nothing else moves
    grammar: named parameters carry over verbatim in both directions, and only the catch-all spelling is rewritten
    no_catch_all: a target declaring no catch-all spelling rejects such a route by name rather than inventing one
    matching_semantics: still the risk a transform cannot rewrite, so rule:route-and-template-checks comparing data:route-table across both builds is unchanged by any of this
  settled_2026_08_10:
    build_tag_axes:
      answer: independent axes, so the backend is not pinned to the TinyGo target
      but: TinyGo plus fasthttp is tier two, compiled and kept compiling but excluded from performance comparison, because that combination is both larger and no faster today
      primary_target: host Go, which the measured 1.44x difference in CPU per request gives its own reason for, independent of anything TinyGo needs
      consequence: the paired files gain a third variant only where the backend genuinely reaches them, and the tier-two rule keeps the fourth quadrant a compile check rather than a supported configuration
    pw_in_the_second_binary:
      answer: absent, a clean split
      consequence: everything transport-free that pw owns has to reach a shared package before the second build can start at all, which is configuration binding, session, the database layer, and observability
      why_not_the_cheap_one: a mixed binary needs no moving and carries the whole net/http stack it never serves with, which gives up the binary size the split is for and leaves two homes for every later decision
      staging: the mixed shape works today and is a legitimate intermediate, so the move is per layer rather than all at once; what the answer settles is the destination, which is what decides where a thing is put when it is touched
    test_seam:
      answer: built first, before more porting
      shape: pwtest holds the neutral request and response, and each transport supplies one Exchange with the same name and signature, so a test moves between them by changing its import
      counted: 86 test files drive handlers through httptest here, 66 of them by building a request and reading a recorder, which is the population that would otherwise have been written twice
      real_server: both halves run a real server over an in-memory pipe rather than a recorder, because half of what is worth testing is decided by the transport and a hand-built request value tests the entry against the test's idea of it
    dev_tooling_scope:
      answer: out of scope, as proposed
      covers: the development console, the identity provider, the telemetry viewer, and the storybook
      why: each is a host-side tool standing up its own server rather than part of the application serving path
  identity_endpoints_2026_08_11:
    was: the largest single item left, and the one this document called too security-sensitive to rush
    answer: not a port; plugin/auth grew auth.Exchange, a transport seam, and every endpoint body was rewritten against it, so both transports drive one implementation of the login
    what_the_seam_carries: the request line, one query parameter, one form field, one header and all of one header, a bounded body, the three connection facts the origin rules read, and the four response operations
    why_not_two_ports: decision:backend-specific-middleware says port the framework middleware set per backend, and this is the boundary where that stops paying; a middleware frame is a few rules, and a login is the accumulated judgement of three protocols
    supporting_moves:
      session: Manager.AttachTo, RotateOn and DestroyOn, plus Jar.LoadFrom
      pwruntime: StoreAuthentication, the write half of the reader that was already portable
      guard: auth.Rules, the resolved protection policy as a value, which pwfast.GuardPolicy already had the shape for
    fasthttp_half: popcornwave/plugin/auth/authfast, about two hundred lines, of which the exchange is most
    all_three_modes_serve: oidc, passkey and jwt_only, each covered by an end-to-end binary against a real provider and a real database
    agreement_test: both listeners are asked the same question over one runtime and the answers are compared, which found a real divergence in Redirect
    still_mixed: authfast links plugin/auth and therefore pw, because the session manager and the extension registry have not moved; the configuration layer, which this entry named as the blocker, is done — see configuration_layer_moved_2026_08_11
  configuration_layer_moved_2026_08_11:
    first_of_four: pw_in_the_second_binary lists configuration binding, session, the database layer and observability as what has to reach a shared package; this is the first
    package: pwconfig, holding the registry, the load, the framework's own bindings and their generated definitions, the environment the load resolves against, and the connection group resolution
    the_earlier_reading_was_wrong: pwruntime's configlookup argued that moving the registry would drag registration, defaults, the environment overlay, scaffold emission and the boot report with it, so the read was published instead; only two of those are runtime-shaped, and both are hooks now
    what_stayed_a_hook: the argument filter that takes framework subcommands off the command line, and the callback the startup summary reads
    chain_settings_followed: the reduction into pwruntime.ChainSettings moved too, so a parse publishes what a chain builder needs; without that a pw-free build parsed a file and then had pwfast.Middlewares refuse for want of settings
    application_surface_unchanged: every type is a true alias and every entry point a thin wrapper, so no application, scaffold or document changed
    proved_by: internal/fastonly, a real package that parses a configuration file and serves one fasthttp request through a chain composed from what it read, whose dependency graph is asserted to contain no pw
    what_is_left: nothing of the four; see all_four_layers_moved_2026_08_11
  all_four_layers_moved_2026_08_11:
    layers:
      pwconfig: the registry, the load, the framework's own bindings, the environment, and the connection group resolution
      pwdatabase: opening the configured pools, the group selectors, and the pool lifetime
      pwsession: the slot registry, the backend registry and its factories, the keyring, the cookie policy, the lifetime arithmetic, and the expiry sweep
      pwobservability: the log backend, the OTLP exporters, the query diagnostics, and the span policy
    what_each_runtime_kept: one frame per layer, and nothing else — manager.Middleware against pwfast.Session, the startup summary that reads what was resolved, and the shutdown order, which is a property of the chain that was built rather than of any layer
    stacking: pwdatabase over pwconfig, pwsession over both, pwobservability over pwconfig, and no edge back; asserted rather than intended, because a cycle here is a startup order nobody could state
    application_surface_unchanged: every moved type is a true alias and every moved entry point a thin wrapper
    proved_by: go list -deps over all four, plus internal/fastonly, which parses a configuration file and serves one fasthttp request in a build whose graph contains no pw
  plugin_freed_2026_08_11:
    was: plugin/auth linked pw for two things, and authfast through it — the extension registration in auth.go and the net/http Exchange in httpexchange.go, which reached pw.WriteProblem and pw.Redirect
    the_split_that_was_not_needed: the plan was plugin/auth/authcore plus 144 aliases in plugin/auth, keeping the documented blank import; what made it unnecessary is that the two things are small and neither needs the runtime, only net/http
    answer: pwextension, a leaf holding the net/http extension registry and the two responses a plugin writes, published by whichever runtime is linked
    net_http_is_not_a_runtime: the leaf names net/http, which is a protocol library; what is worth not linking is the framework built on it
    no_counterpart_on_the_second_transport: pwfast.Middlewares takes its frames as arguments and reads no registry, so this registry is the net/http chain's and a plugin hands the other transport a frame directly
    honest_defaults: with no runtime published, Problem writes the document without the error page and Redirect falls back to net/http's helper; the status, headers and body are all still there and only the presentation a browser would have preferred is not
    fell_out_of_it: the problem document was built by hand in both runtimes and is now pwruntime.AppendProblemJSON, so one response body is described once
    cost: no aliases, no package split, and the documented import line is unchanged
    proved_by: authfastjwte2e, which starts through pwconfig, plugin/auth and pwfast with no pw in its graph and asserts that, and go list -deps over plugin/auth and authfast
  generator_wired_2026_08_11:
    was: the critical path; every runtime piece existed and nothing produced the second build, so project.fasthttp only added a build constraint and an application could not be built for fasthttp at all
    now: pw generate emits it — the derived handlers, the second transport's page tree, and the constraint on the first transport's half
    derived_handlers: the upstream derivation, asked for by setting Options.Transform, arriving as artifacts with the rest
    derived_binders: the same run's binders and writers over the fasthttp request value, which pwfast.Parse dispatches through; without them the second build compiles and answers 500 on the first request, because that registry is filled by generated init functions
    the_rule_that_had_to_be_settled_first: generated code is output rather than input; the derivation read the whole loaded package, so a project that had generated once refused on its own previous binder — see requirement:tinybind-alternate-backend-support, fixed upstream in v0.5.5
    declined_from_the_same_run: the generator's own route registration, which installs on the router its transform target names; a page tree here installs on pwfastpage.Router and brings its own
    page_tree: emitted twice and compared, so what gets a second copy is decided by the bytes rather than by a list of file names kept in agreement with an emitter this framework does not own
    what_differs: the route decoder and the registry, which read the request and install on a router; the compiled components come out identical and are written once for both builds
    ordering: the second tree is a later step than the per-directory stages, because a server action is discovered by its signature and the fasthttp-shaped one is the derived handler this run had not written yet
    refusals: a build error naming the occurrence, its chain and the upstream remedy, plus one sentence upstream cannot say — a refusal naming a pw call is requirement:pw-call-registration rather than an application defect
    compiled_rather_than_inspected: internal/fastfixture is one authored package whose generated halves are committed and whose both tag configurations are built; every other test here asserts something about the source that was produced, and this is what would catch two halves that each look right and do not fit
    route_registration: the routes an application registers itself are emitted onto pwfast.RouteInstaller, from the same table the authored wiring declares; the authored wiring is net/http-shaped and the tag excludes it, so without this the second build compiled and served nothing
    catch_all_spelling: the emitter is told Go's own suffix, which reads like a no-op and is not — it leaves a pattern exactly as the net/http source spelled it, so the one translation to this transport's router happens inside pwfast where the subtree and the {$} marker are translated too
  entry_point_2026_08_11:
    was: every layer had a shared home and nothing sequenced them, so a deployment hand-wrote the parse, the pool, the observability, the session manager, the limiter's counter and the chain in an order only this repository knew
    now: pwfast.Start does that and returns the shutdown that releases it, and pwfast.Run owns the port around it
    where_it_lives: pwfast rather than beside it, because pwfast.Run is what pw.Run rewrites to and an import rewrite maps one package onto one package
    what_that_cost: pwfast reaches pwconfig, which the layering test used to forbid; the property that clause protected is intact and still proven, since Middlewares composes from published settings alone and a test seam, an end-to-end fixture and internal/fastonly all build a chain with nothing parsed
    plugins: WithRuntimeOptions, which is the shape an authentication plugin's Apply already has; there is still no frame registry on this transport, and pwextension.SetupProcess runs the startup half of every registered extension so a storage plugin's blank import means the same thing in both builds
    build_target: api:cli-build and api:cli-generate take --target fasthttp, which adds the tag to the compile and to the development-import check; a target the project never declared is refused rather than compiled into undefined symbols
  rate_limiting_2026_08_11:
    was: pw installs two frames and pwfast installed neither, so a fasthttp deployment ran with ratelimit.enabled = true and no limiter — a control that looks installed
    moved: pwratelimit holds the counter, the store registry, and the Limiter that decides the bucket, the count, the exemption and the admission; both transports drive that one Limiter and supply only the canonical path, the caller's address and how a 429 is written
    configuration: pwruntime, beside CSRFConfig and SecurityHeadersConfig, which is where a setting both transports build a frame from already lives
    counter_is_startup: supplied rather than opened in the frame, like the session manager, because the Redis backend dials a server and refuses to start against one it cannot reach; enabled with no counter is refused
  storage_plugins_2026_08_11:
    was: database/dynamo and database/firestore linked pw for their registration and nothing else
    fact_that_made_it_cheap: both install no middleware at all, because the request path reads a process handle rather than a context node
    now: registered through pwextension, started by pwextension.SetupProcess, and an extension that does return a frame is refused there by name rather than dropped
  scaffold_2026_08_11:
    what_it_writes: main_fasthttp.go beside main.go, and a build constraint on every authored file typed by one transport — the mux wiring, the handlers, the page tree loader
    what_it_moved: the request and response types out of the files that read them, because a build tag excludes a whole file and the derived handler reads those types too; the split is written for every project rather than only for one declaring the second build, since one layout is easier to teach than two and it is the layout this framework's own rule asks for
    auth: the second entry point names authfast.Contribute, because the other build gains those frames from an import and a chain assembled from arguments does not
    plugin_registration: pwextension.Extension gained SecondTransport, which names the package serving a capability on the other transport; an extension that declares one is left alone by SetupProcess, since running its startup there as well would build the same runtime twice — without it every fasthttp build linking plugin/auth refused to start
    how_it_is_checked: structurally rather than by compiling, because a scaffolded project is its own module; a test reads the scaffold and holds it to the rule — an excluded file declares no type, const or var the other half needs — and internal/fastfixture is the same layout compiled under both tags
  compiled_and_served_2026_08_11:
    what: examples/helloworld, a real application, built for both transports and run
    result: the fasthttp binary serves the page, renders the document shell, counts the visit in SQLite, and its dependency graph contains no pw; the two builds answer byte-identical markup and, after the fixes below, an identical header set
    what_it_found_that_nothing_else_did:
      generated_registrations_named_pw: the document shell and the reloadable registration are emitted into an application package, and both named pw — so every fasthttp build linked the net/http runtime and registered its document in the half that was not serving; they name pwruntime now, which is where the registry always was
      scaffolded_error_page_named_pw: the same defect in an authored file, fixed the same way; pwruntime gained HTMLFragment so the file reads as it did
      application_config_registration: pw.RegisterConfig is the documented application entry and links pw into a file both builds compile; pwconfig.Register is the portable spelling, and the example uses it
      cache_policy_absent: pwfast rendered HTML with no Cache-Control and no Vary at all, so a page belonging to one reader was cacheable by a shared proxy on one transport and not the other; the verdict comes from the templates, so both halves now read it from the same source
      server_banner: fasthttp announced itself in a header the other transport does not send
    why_only_a_real_application_found_them: each is a file an application owns or a header a browser reads, and every test here drove a handler or an artifact rather than a built binary
    migration_it_documents: declare project.fasthttp, run pw generate, tag the authored files typed by one transport, and add the second entry point — which is what api:cli-init now scaffolds for a new project
  complex_features_2026_08_11:
    driven: async_render, live_render, partial_update and htmx_fragment, each built both ways and the interesting request actually made
    async: works, and the derivation reads well — pw.Go survives with its context, and a handler whose parameter name collided gets a fresh one with the original rebound; a page with two pending values renders identically to the first transport's
    async_needed: pwfast had no Go, Resolved or Failed at all, so every derived handler that started work called a function that did not exist
    live: works — the same NDJSON record protocol, head record and deliveries addressed by boundary id, streamed
    what_live_needed_first:
      published_settings: nothing published the update settings in a build without pw, so the whole surface was inert — no live, no redraw, no partial update; the reduction is pwconfig's now, published by Parse beside the chain settings
      the_wrong_switch: ServeLive gated on update.enabled, which is a different setting answering a different request; live is gated by html.live and streaming, so a project asking only for live got none
      the_wrong_header: it read the update module's mode token, and the browser runtime this framework ships sends Pw-Response-Mode; the constants are shared now, since they are the wire between one client and either half
      unflushed_records: the loop wrote into the bufio.Writer a body stream writer is handed and never flushed, so a subscription held a connection open and delivered nothing
      the_access_log_drained_it: Response.Body on a body stream materializes the stream to answer, so logging the size consumed a subscription that by design does not end — the request never completed and no byte reached the client
    a_test_agreed_with_the_bug: the live protocol test published update.enabled and sent the module's header, so implementation and test matched each other and both disagreed with the client; it asserts the shipped contract now
    error_pages: pwfast answered every failure with a problem document, so a browser never saw the application's error page; it negotiates on Accept through the shared rule and renders the registered page through the document shell, exactly as the other half does
  browser_runtime_2026_08_11:
    was: the second build served no /_pw script at all, so a page rendered with a script tag pointing at a 404 — both server halves of the update surface worked and nothing client-side could reach them
    moved: pwbrowser, holding the embedded asset, the module set, the revision the URL carries, which paths the set claims, and the cache policy; the unminified sources moved beside it, since they are the source of the thing it serves
    why_a_leaf_rather_than_a_copy: a document naming the runtime is rendered by whichever half is running and an application's template names that URL once, so two runtimes each embedding their own copy would be two revisions of one asset and a page rendered by one build would load a script the other does not serve
    what_each_transport_keeps: reading a path off a request and writing the response, plus closing the reserved namespace so an unclaimed path there never reaches application routing
    build_modes_still_differ: the development set adds a module and an import and therefore lands on a different revision, which is published rather than branched on — a deployed build publishes nothing and both transports land on one revision
    proved_by: both binaries of examples/live_render name /_pw/15d90b93c185664b/popcornwave-runtime.js and serve the same 20310 bytes at it, and a stale revision answers 404 on each
  command_line_2026_08_11:
    was: the second build took no command line at all — every flag was an unknown flag, --generate-config did nothing, the health probe was unreachable, and an application's own subcommand could not be named
    why: the argument filter that lifts the framework's words off the line was a pw hook, and a build without pw installed none
    moved: pwconfig, which already owns the line through Hooks.Args — the framework actions, the health probe, and the subcommand registry
    the_filter_is_no_longer_optional: a nil Args hook used to mean no filtering; it now means the framework's own words are still taken off the line, so a build that installs no hook still answers them and a runtime sets one only to add
    application_subcommands: registered through pwconfig, and the generator recognizes that spelling as well as the pw one — a subcommand's declaring file is compiled by both builds, so naming a runtime there would put it in only one
    proved_by: both binaries of examples/helloworld answer "seed --count 42 --table orders" identically, take its declared defaults identically, list it identically for an unknown command, and give the same answer for --generate-config, an unknown flag, a config flag, and the health probe
  still_missing:
    websocket: requirement:contrib-websocket, blocked on a dependency decision rather than on work here
    dev_tooling: out of scope, per dev_tooling_scope above
  open_here:
    superseded_note: the four entries below were the open list; all four are answered in settled_2026_08_10 above and are kept here for the reasoning rather than as questions
    test_seam:
      fact: 77 files in this repository drive handlers through httptest, and the other backend tests through an in-memory listener instead
      risk: without a backend-neutral seam in the test utilities first, every one of those tests is written twice
      owner: api:test-run and decision:testutil-testing-interface
      rank: highest leverage of anything on this list, and the easiest to skip
    build_tag_axes:
      today: two axes already, the TinyGo target and decision:force-tinygo-logic, visible as the paired files in pw
      question: whether the backend is a third independent axis or is pinned to the TinyGo target, which decides whether every paired file needs a third variant
      sharper_now: the upstream fork exists because the fasthttp backend is aimed at TinyGo, which suggests the two are not independent, and settling it decides the size of the matrix
    dev_tooling_scope:
      fact: the development console, the identity provider, the telemetry viewer, and the storybook each construct their own net/http server and are host-side tools rather than the application serving path
      proposal: declare them out of scope, so the port does not grow to include them
    handler_file_layout: a transport handler must sit in a file of its own, per decision:transport-source-transform, which the scaffolds and examples must be made to satisfy
  do_first_here:
    what: register the pw surface per requirement:pw-call-registration, then run the upstream report-only generation over the examples, scaffolds, and tutorial
    why: it produces the actual work list rather than an estimate, and a clean run is the definition of an application that can adopt the backend
    cost: low, and the registration is useful whether or not a backend is ever shipped
non_goals:
  - shipping a fasthttp backend
  - hiding http.ResponseWriter and '*http.Request' from handler signatures, which decision:root-pw-api deliberately keeps visible and testable
  - a compatibility layer of any kind, which upstream specified and did not implement
```
