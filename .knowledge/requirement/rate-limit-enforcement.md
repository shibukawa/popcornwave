title: Rate Limit Enforcement
---
The decision half of a request limit: who is counted, over what scope, in which store, by which algorithm, and what happens when the store is unreachable.

```yaml
status: proposed
completes: requirement:rate-limit-problem-responses, whose closing rule defers client identity, counting scope, storage, and limiting algorithm; this concept answers those four and adds nothing to the wire
already_built:
  verified: 2026-08-10, by reading the tree
  shipped: the 429 problem, RateLimit carrying limit, remaining, reset, and retryAfter, Retry-After and X-RateLimit-* serialization, Cache-Control no-store, the header carry-through in the error renderer, and the scaffolded 429 template
  consequence: the remaining work is a counter and a placement, which is far smaller than the rate limits concern of policy:web-middleware reads
waiting_consumers:
  reauthentication: policy:reauthentication requires repeated failures rate-limited per session and per account, and no limiter exists to do it
  presence:
    asks_for: requirement:presence-signal requires its endpoint bounded and rate-limited
    gets: the identity bucket, since no per-route rule exists to give it its own
    consequence: a presence tick spends the caller's budget like any other request, so the configured limit is sized with the tick interval in mind rather than against page views alone; an endpoint-specific bound is an API gateway rule if a deployment wants one
  live: the process-wide admission control open question of policy:live-subscription-bounds
  finding: three concepts already depend on a limiter this framework does not have, which is why this is a requirement rather than an idea
division_of_labor:
  premise: decision:local-tls-proxy-boundary and decision:ingress-tls-termination put a proxy in front of the normal deployment, and that proxy already limits by address
  edge_owns:
    - first-line volumetric defence, where the useful place to drop a flood is before it costs a connection
    - per-route and per-operation quotas, which an API gateway expresses and this framework deliberately does not
  framework_owns:
    - per-authenticated-subject limits, which the edge cannot compute because it does not resolve the session
    - a bounded per-address floor, as depth behind the edge rather than in place of it, per the two_layer_flood_defence of data:rate-limit-runtime-config
    - a process ceiling, which is the only layer here that sees a distributed flood, since such a flood keeps every source under any per-address value by construction
    - failure-outcome limits, where what is counted is a result and not an arrival
  consequence: per-operation quotas are not this framework's job at all, and volumetric defence is the edge's first line with two bounded backstops here, which is what keeps this a simple implementation
  what_remains_is_small: one bucket keyed on identity, one unkeyed ceiling, and a counter the authentication endpoints call
identity:
  key: the authenticated subject where there is one, and the resolved client address otherwise
  address_source: requirement:proxied-request-identity, which is a hard dependency; an unresolved address behind a proxy collapses every anonymous caller into one bucket, which turns a limit into an outage
  shared_with: the client_key of policy:live-subscription-bounds, which computes the same thing today and must not compute it twice
  never_a_key: a session identifier, since rotating one would reset a limit, and an unauthenticated caller controls when that happens
scope:
  granularity: one bucket per identity across every route, and that is the whole granularity; there are no per-route rules and no pattern grammar to configure
  process_wide: a total arrival ceiling, unkeyed, which is both the shedding valve answering the open question policy:live-subscription-bounds left about where admission control belongs, and the only layer that sees a distributed flood
  address_has_no_off_position: the anonymous bucket is always bounded, unlike the subject bucket, because it is the only one an unauthenticated flood meets and an unlimited value there is an absent control rather than a permissive one
  composition: a request meets the process ceiling first and the identity bucket second, which is the placement order below rather than a separate rule, and the first refusal answers; the response never says which refused, for the reason policy:csrf-protection gives about naming the failed half
  fixed_exclusions:
    members: policy:operational-endpoints and the mount of requirement:public-asset-delivery
    why_not_optional: a readiness probe arrives from the proxy on the same address as every anonymous caller and would exhaust that bucket by itself, and one page view fetches many assets, so counting either turns the limit into an outage on the first deploy
    not_configurable: these are endpoints the framework owns and routes, so the carve-out is a fact about them rather than a policy a deployment tunes
  no_per_route_rules:
    delegated: an API gateway, which is where a per-operation quota belongs and where a deployment needing one already has the surface
    why: a pattern grammar, a precedence order, and a per-rule store key are most of the cost of a limiter, and they buy a capability the boundary in front already sells
    still_covered: policy:reauthentication does not need a route rule, because what it bounds is a failure count the endpoint reports through failure_counting rather than an arrival a pattern would match
storage:
  need: atomic increment with expiry, which is the whole interface
  seam: a backend selection like the session backend, not a new subsystem
  configuration: data:rate-limit-runtime-config
  in_process:
    default: yes, because a limiter that requires a dependency to start is one nobody enables
    stated_limit: N replicas enforce N times the configured limit, which must be documented at the configuration key rather than discovered in production
  redis:
    assumed: the deployed backend, adding a counter to the expiring-record and one-time-token use cases of requirement:contrib-redis-valkey
    operation: increment and set an expiry on first write, which is one round trip and the reason this backend is the one that ships
  not_now: the SQL, DynamoDB, and Firestore session backends can all express the operation, and none is committed; a second backend is worth adding when a deployment has no Redis rather than in advance
  never: a cookie or any client-held counter, which is a counter the counted party edits
algorithm:
  constrained_by_the_wire: RateLimit carries a Remaining count and a Reset instant, which is a window counter; a token bucket has no reset instant and a fractional remaining, so the shipped response contract already excluded that family
  choice: fixed window
  known_cost: a caller can send twice the limit across a window boundary
  why_acceptable: the framework's scope is a per-identity allowance, where the boundary burst is a doubled allowance rather than a flood; volumetric protection is the edge's, per division_of_labor
  upgrade_path: a sliding window counter fits the same wire shape at one extra read, and is what to reach for if the boundary burst ever matters
failure_mode:
  unreachable_store: fail open, admit the request, and count it
  why: the deployment still has the edge's own limits, so failing open degrades to edge-only protection rather than to none; failing closed converts a store blip into an outage of every limited route at once, including login
  observability: a counter for admissions made without a working store, because a limiter that is silently not limiting is the worst of the three states
  advisory: rule:configuration-advisories reports an enabled limiter with an in-process store, since that configuration is correct on one replica and wrong on the deployment shape this framework targets
placement:
  identity_bucket: a framework extension below the authentication slot, because one bucket keyed on subject-or-address cannot know which it is until the subject is resolved; this is the same placement policy:csrf-protection takes and for the same reason
  process_ceiling: the outer stack, since an unkeyed arrival count needs nothing resolved and a valve is worth less the further in it sits
  failure_counting:
    distinct: what policy:reauthentication needs is a count of failed outcomes, not of arrivals, and no middleware can see an outcome the handler has not produced yet
    shape: the limiter exposes the counter, and api:authentication-endpoints decides what to count into it
    consequence: the surface is a counter with an increment and a check, not only a middleware
    thresholds: declared by data:authentication-runtime-config rather than data:rate-limit-runtime-config, because a count of failed attempts over a long period is a different shape from an arrival rate and only the authentication plugin knows what a failure is
acceptance:
  - a bucket keyed on subject counts one browser once across replicas when a shared store is configured
  - an anonymous caller behind a proxy is counted per client, not per proxy node, which is the requirement:proxied-request-identity dependency made testable
  - a readiness probe and a page's asset requests consume no budget, which is the fixed_exclusions carve-out made testable and is what fails first if it is dropped
  - an unreachable store admits requests and increments the degraded counter
  - a refusal carries the metadata requirement:rate-limit-problem-responses already validates, and names nothing about why
  - a failed authentication increments an account-scoped counter that an arriving request does not
  - the process ceiling refuses with the same 429 as the identity bucket, so a client sees one behaviour from two mechanisms
  - a configuration with zero per_address is refused at startup, and one whose per_address exceeds a positive process is refused with both values named
  - a flood spread across many addresses, each staying under per_address, is refused by the process ceiling and by nothing else, which is the case that justifies that key
open_questions:
  - none blocking; per-route granularity was considered and delegated to an API gateway, and the process-wide valve refuses rather than degrades, since degradation is a property of a live response rather than of an arrival
