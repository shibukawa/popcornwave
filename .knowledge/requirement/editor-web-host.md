title: Editor Support in a Web Host
---
A .pw.* file opened in a browser-hosted editor keeps every feature that needs no process, and says plainly which features it does not have, because a web host can run no pw binary at all.

```yaml
status: the statement of absence is implemented; the web build itself is not, because a web extension host needs a bundled single file and this extension ships unbundled CommonJS
stage: 3 of vision:editor-support
hosts: vscode.dev, github.dev, and any remote host with no local file system, which the extension already declares support for through its virtual-workspace capability
works_today:
  highlighting: requirement:template-syntax-highlighting, a grammar with no process
  formatting: requirement:editor-formatting through the embedded module of decision:formatter-delivery, which policy:editor-tool-execution already classifies as extension content rather than a binary
does_not_work:
  everything_from_stage_2: api:cli-lsp is a binary, and a web host runs none
  requirement:editor-tasks: every command spawns a process
statement_of_absence:
  rule: the extension reports which features are unavailable and why, once, rather than appearing to be a broken language server
  reason: requirement:extension-distribution already asks the readme to prevent that impression; a web host makes it a runtime statement rather than a documentation one
open_question:
  what: whether api:cli-lsp is compiled to WebAssembly so stage 2 works with no binary, the way decision:formatter-delivery did for formatting
  in_favor: the analysis is Go, decision:force-tinygo-logic already constrains it, and the formatter proved the delivery path
  against:
    - the server loads a project model across many files, and a web host's file access is an editor API rather than a file system
    - requirement:pw-language-server reads popcornweb.toml and the whole source tree, which is a far larger reach than one buffer
    - it would be a second delivery of the same analysis, which is the cost decision:formatter-delivery already accepted once and named
  decide_when: requirement:pw-language-server is implemented and its project-loading reach is measured rather than estimated
non_goals:
  - downloading a binary into a web host, which policy:editor-tool-execution forbids everywhere
  - a reduced language server that answers from one buffer, which would be a third analysis
acceptance:
  - a .pw.html opened from a repository in a web host highlights and formats
  - the unavailable features are stated once per session, naming the reason
  - no feature silently fails
```
