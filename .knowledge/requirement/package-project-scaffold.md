title: Package Preset Scaffold
---
The package preset of requirement:init-presets writes a concept:component-package repository whose generated Go is tracked rather than ignored, and whose CI fails on a stale artifact, because a consumer regenerates nothing and a stale commit is what it links.

```yaml
audience: actor:application-developer publishing a capability rather than running one
same_scaffold_as: the pw init --kind package path of api:cli-package; this preset is that path named in the list rather than a second one
why_in_the_list: a reader deciding what to create is looking at the preset list, and a --kind flag is discoverable only by someone who already knows the feature exists
version_control:
  inverted_rule: decision:committed-package-artifacts, which is the one policy:generated-artifacts rule this project kind reverses
  gitignore:
    omits: the **/*_pw_gen.go rule the application scaffold writes
    keeps: every other entry, including the public/**/*.zstd sidecar, which stays excluded because requirement:package-asset-delivery serves package assets from embedded bytes
  vscode:
    keeps: the .vscode/settings.json hide rule for **/*_pw_gen.go
    reason: hiding a file from an explorer is not excluding it from a commit, and an author reads the source rather than the artifact either way
  extracted_assets: a component style or script the generator extracts is tracked too, on the same reasoning
  first_commit: the scaffold runs api:cli-generate, so the initial commit already carries the artifacts rather than teaching the author that an empty tree is the normal state
staleness_guard:
  problem: the whole distribution model rests on the committed artifact matching the source, and nothing in the consumer can detect that it does not beyond a compile error naming the package
  scaffolded: a CI workflow running api:cli-check over the package, which decision:committed-package-artifacts already names as the package's release gate and which nothing wrote until now
  why_scaffolded_rather_than_documented: an author who forgets it publishes a package that fails to compile in somebody else's project, and the failure is discovered by that somebody
  release: the same check is the tag gate, so a published version never carries an artifact its source does not produce
what_is_not_written:
  entry_point: no concept:application-entry-point and no generated registration linker, because the consumer owns the binary
  document_shell: none, per concept:component-package; decision:implicit-document-shell registers exactly one and it is the application's
  environment_config: none, because policy:config-file-resolution resolves those in the consumer
  devbox: none, unless the package's own tests need a service
  queries: no generate.queries entry, per the requirement:component-package-distribution non-goal about .pw.sql in a package
questions_not_asked:
  list: router, authentication, session storage, database, database engine, DynamoDB, Redis, Tailwind, TinyGo, and Devbox
  reason: each describes an application, and this project is not one
  tinygo_specifically: there is no binary to compile, and the package stays inside rule:tinygo-runtime-compatibility whatever the consumer chose, so the answer would decide nothing
  hub: decision:navigable-answer-hub shows the project name and nothing else for this kind
written:
  config: data:project-config with project.kind package, no project.main, and the data:component-package-manifest package section naming the pw and system:tinybind versions it generates against
  module: go.mod at the module path the author gives, which is the project name question asking for a module path here rather than a directory name
  starter: one component or handler of the shape being authored, plus its generated artifact
  editor: .editorconfig and .vscode settings, unchanged from the application scaffold
  readme: the install line a consumer pastes, since decision:declared-package-installation makes the install two lines the author has to state somewhere
  generation_purposes: every purpose declared, with only templates non-empty, because none has a default and an omitted one is refused rather than inferred
  linked_package:
    key: package.import, naming the directory the starter sits in rather than the module root
    why: a generation purpose may not name ".", so the Go lives one level down; the consumer's generated bootstrap imports what this key says, and without it the import is the module root, which holds no Go
    symptom_without_it: the consumer fails at go mod tidy with "does not contain package", naming a module whose own build succeeded
    found_by: declaring a scaffolded package in a scaffolded application and building it
module_resolution:
  rule: a package resolves its module twice, once before generation and once after
  why: a package's only Go is the generated Go, so the first resolution runs over a module with no imports to find and the artifacts generation then writes name packages nothing has required
  contrast: an application has handwritten sources naming those same packages before its first resolution, which is why it needs one run
  found_by: building a scaffolded package, which failed on the generated file's own import
project_name_question:
  differs: a package is named by its module path, because that is what a consumer types
  effect: the validation is a module path rather than a directory name, and the directory is its last element
  reason: a package named myapp and published at github.com/someone/myapp would have to be renamed before its first release
unavailable_afterwards:
  commands: api:cli-dev and api:cli-build, which api:cli-package already reports as not applying to this kind
  reason: there is nothing to run, and the package's tests are the loop
acceptance:
  - a project created from this preset commits its generated Go on the first commit
  - its CI fails when a source is edited and the artifact is not regenerated
  - a consumer naming the published module links it with go build alone, per requirement:component-package-distribution
  - the preset asks the module path and nothing else
  - pw dev and pw build in the created project report that they do not apply to a package
non_goals:
  - publishing, tagging, or releasing the package
  - a component-library package, which requirement:cross-package-components blocks upstream
  - a template repository or a registry entry
```
