title: Scriptless Action Forms
---
A form carrying `server-action` submits to a working endpoint with no browser runtime, so adopting a server action costs none of the no-JavaScript behaviour requirement:classic-web-acceptance asks for.

```yaml
source: the scriptless_forms note of api:page-action-endpoint, and the downstream_dependency system:tinybind records against its own script-free render mode
the_condition_this_restores: requirement:classic-web-acceptance criteria works without the Popcorn Web browser runtime, which a route adopting server actions cannot meet today
today:
  emitted: data-pw-action alone, per the scripted lowering set system:tinybind applies
  no_method: that lowering deliberately writes no action, method, hidden selector, or hidden token, because it assumes a runtime intercepts the submit
  what_a_browser_does_with_it: a form declaring no method is a GET form, so a native submit navigates to the current URL with the fields as a query string and the handler never runs
  the_same_with_the_runtime: requirement:action-invocation-runtime records that the GET interception takes it too, so the failure is not specific to scripting being off
  no_application_workaround: an author-written action on a form carrying server-action is a generation error, and the hash is not a value an author can compute
csrf_is_coupled_to_the_method:
  fact: requirement:module-native-csrf has system:tinybind insert the hidden token into every unsafe form, meaning post, put, patch and delete
  consequence: a form the lowering leaves without a method is a GET form to that insertion too, so no token field is written and none is needed
  therefore: emitting method=post is what makes the token appear, and the two cannot be sequenced apart
  get_form_refusal_still_holds: the module refuses a token on a GET form, so nothing here asks for one
shipped_upstream_2026_08_12:
  version: system:tinybind v0.5.8, answering the request this requirement produced
  emitted: method=post, a hidden _action selector carrying hash and name, and the token the module then inserts, beside the runtime attribute, from one build
  no_action_attribute: none is written, deliberately; a form declaring none submits to the document URL, which already holds this page's path parameters and whose query a POST keeps
  why_that_beats_what_was_asked_for: decision:action-entry-point-selection asked for the page pattern to be written into the attribute, and this reaches the same destination with nothing to write and no render-time channel carrying the request path
  registration: the page registers POST beside its GET, and the generated dispatcher branches on the selector
  selector_channel: the query is read before the body, so a submit button's formaction overrides the form's own field rather than merely coexisting with it
  default_response_helper: httpbind.DispatchAction runs the handler and redirects only if it wrote nothing, observing the response rather than asking the handler for a flag
  bare_button_unchanged: it registers nothing extra, because a button has no native submit to serve
two_shapes_as_evaluated_before:
  kept_for_the_reasoning: the choice was between the direct endpoint and the page pattern, and upstream took the page's own URL by omission rather than by writing it
  the_deciding_argument_held: a handler must not be able to read its path parameters from one entry point and not the other
default_response:
  rule: a handler that wrote nothing gets a 303 back to the page URL
  why: post-redirect-get, so a reload does not resubmit and the address bar keeps showing the page
  override: a handler that wrote a status, a header, or a body has that response stand, which is how it redirects elsewhere or renders validation errors inline
  mechanism: the generated wrapper observes whether the handler wrote anything, so the handler needs no flag and no framework type
  unchanged_for_the_scripted_path: the direct entry point adds no redirect, since a fetch has nothing to navigate
a_bare_button_has_no_scriptless_form:
  fact: nothing invokes an element that is not a submit control, and the generator cannot wrap it in a form without knowing an ancestor chain it cannot see
  upstream_rule: under the script-free mode server-action on anything but a form is a generation error naming the position
  the_choice_here: whether that error fires depends on whether both lowerings are emitted or one is selected per build, which is decision:action-entry-point-selection
  authoring_consequence_either_way: a form works with and without a runtime and a bare button works only with one, which is what rule:server-action-authoring tells an author
relation_to_the_scriptless_render_path:
  what_exists: pw/scriptless.go detects a scripting-off browser at request time through a noscript redirect and renders that request buffered
  what_it_is_for: making an async page arrive settled rather than as fallbacks nothing replaces
  what_it_is_not: a lowering switch; the markup a form carries is decided at generation and the same bytes reach both clients
  why_that_matters: system:tinybind places its mode switch at generation and calls a per-request switch cloaking, and this framework's detection does not contradict that, because it selects a render entry rather than different markup
  therefore: a form that works both ways has to work from one set of attributes, which is the whole argument of decision:action-entry-point-selection
caching:
  rule: a component holding an unsafe form cannot be output-cached, which requirement:module-native-csrf already enforces at generation across the call graph
  new_here: a form that was a GET form under the scripted lowering becomes an unsafe one, so a page cached today can start failing that check
  reading: the check firing is correct and the shape it pushes is unchanged, which is to split the cacheable list from the form that carries the token
acceptance:
  - a form carrying server-action reaches its handler with scripting disabled
  - the same form keeps the page URL in the address bar and survives a reload
  - a handler that writes nothing redirects back to the page, and one that writes anything produces exactly that
  - one page holding several forms dispatches to the one that was submitted
  - a submitted form without a valid token is rejected before the handler runs
  - a form on a parameterized route reaches a handler that can read the route's parameters
  - no form carrying server-action is ever submitted as a GET, with or without the runtime
  - a project using no server action regenerates byte-identical output
open_questions:
  - whether a submit button carrying its own action inside a form uses formaction with the selector in the query, which is the native per-button override and the shape system:tinybind chose
  - whether a page rendering an inline validation response has to restate the whole page, given the handler owns its whole response and the page's Load already knows how to render it
