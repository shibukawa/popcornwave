title: Explicit Page Loading
---
Retire the typed Load rung of concept:page-tree, so a discovered page loads through a declared external its own template calls rather than through a generated call the author cannot see.

```yaml
status: done 2026-08-14; system:tinybind v0.5.11 removed the rung, v0.5.12 fixed the defect that blocked adoption, and the fixture, the tests, and the scaffold moved here
what_is_retired: the typed rung alone — page.go declaring `func Load(id string, page int) (User, error)`, whose results become the page component's parameter list
what_stays:
  template_only: a page with no page.go, whose data is its own external calls
  handler: page.go declaring `func Load(w, r)`, which owns its whole response and is the escape hatch every case below falls back to
why_now:
  val: system:tinybind v0.5.10 binds a synchronous external's result to a name, so a template can call its loader once and read the value in several places
  before_val: an explicit call was possible but each mention re-called it, so the implicit rung was the only shape that loaded once
  upstream_removed_it: v0.5.11, with a diagnostic naming the val shape
the_shape_it_replaces:
  was: |
    page.go:   func Load(id string) (User, error)
    template:  component Page(user: User): html
  becomes: |
    template:  external LoadUser(id: string): User
               component Page(id: string): html {
               {val user = LoadUser(id)}
  moved: the call site, from generated code into the template that consumes the value
why_it_is_worth_removing:
  one_less_rung: rungs are selected by a signature, so three shapes mean an author reads a signature to know which handler was generated; two mean the question is only whether page.go exists
  the_contract_disappears: the typed rung checks the page component's parameter list against Load's result list by count, order, and type, and a mismatch is a generation error about two lists the author never wrote as a pair
  invisible_call_site: nothing in the page's own source says the loader runs, so the data flow is readable only in generated output
  parameters_become_the_input:
    fact: under the typed rung a page component's parameters are the load's results, and under this one they are the URL segments
    consequence: requirement:component-output-cache keys on declared parameters, so only the second shape can cache a page by its identifier
    why_that_matters: keyed on loaded data a page cache is worthless, because computing the key requires the load it was meant to avoid; keyed on the id it covers the load and the render together
    strongest_argument: the typed rung structurally cannot become a fetch-and-render cache, and removing it is what puts every discovered page within reach of one
what_val_does_not_replace:
  the_error_path:
    today: the generated handler calls Load, and a non-nil error becomes a problem response through api:error-renderer before anything is rendered or committed
    at_v0_5_10: a synchronous external has no error result, so a failing load returns a zero value and the page renders empty; the planned val error handling is what closes this and depends_on tracks it
    severity: this is the whole cost of the change, and it is not small — a record that does not exist is the common case, and answering it with 404 before commit is what the typed rung is actually for
  ordering_matters_too: the decision to fail has to precede the first byte; an await boundary's recover renders error markup inside an already-committed 200, so it is not a substitute for a status
depends_on:
  what: a failing load must be reportable from the template, since that is the half val does not replace
  answered_by: system:tinybind v0.5.11 failing_external, which lets a synchronous external return a trailing error when it is the whole value of a binding; the template declaration is unchanged and the error is read from the Go source
  read_unwrapped: nothing in the render path wraps it, so an error carrying HTTP intent reaches api:error-renderer through errors.As
  the_ordering_half: system:tinybind hoists a chain member's top-level bindings to run during assembly, before the first byte; its own value-binding-hoisting decision carries the design
the_test_that_decides:
  question: does a failed load reach a problem response before the first byte, or error markup inside a response already committed 200
  answer: before commit, so the rung goes; measured against v0.5.12 rather than taken from the release notes
  how_it_arrives_here: the generated handler renders through pwpage.Render and writes pw.WriteProblem on its error, which is the path that already existed; the binding's failure reaches it with nothing written
  what_this_framework_had_to_change_for_it: nothing on the error path, which is why the wiring was the fixture, the tests, and the scaffold rather than the runtime
  not_for_a_cached_leaf: a plan carrying a storing cache policy is not hoisted, so a cached page gives up the status choice on a miss; upstream states the trade and requirement:component-output-cache carries what it means here
migration:
  done_here: the page-tree fixture, the shared generation fixture, and the pw new page scaffold
  scaffold: the typed rung became the loader rung, which writes the external declaration, the val binding, and a loader returning a trailing error
  scaffold_defect_found: the retired rung's test asserted only the emitted text, so the scaffold wrote a project that failed generation while the suite stayed green; the replacement runs the generator over what it scaffolds
  no_silent_change: upstream refuses the old signature and names the new shape, so nothing falls through to the handler rung
acceptance:
  - a page loading through a declared external and a val binding renders what the typed rung rendered
  - the page component of such a page declares the URL segments, so an annotation on it keys on the identifier
  - a page.go declaring the retired signature fails generation and names this requirement
  - the handler rung is unaffected
  - the scaffolds and the tutorial carry the explicit shape, since the implicit one stops existing
open_questions:
  - whether the tutorial and the discovered-routing guide need more than the mechanical rewrite, since the rung was a teaching device as well as a mechanism
