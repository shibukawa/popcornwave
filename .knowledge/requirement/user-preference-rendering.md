title: User Preference Rendering
---
The first painted frame already matches the reader's color scheme, motion, and contrast preference, with no script pass and no repaint.

```yaml
problem:
  flash:
    what: a reader who prefers dark sees a light frame before the theme applies
    cause: the deciding value is readable only by script, and script runs after the parser has painted
    real_scope: an explicit site override only
    why_narrower_than_it_looks: an unoverridden operating-system preference never flashes, because prefers-color-scheme answers it in CSS before first paint, in every browser, with no server involvement
    consequence: the case worth server work is the one CSS cannot see, not the one it already handles
  layout:
    what: a document that branches markup on viewport width must guess the width
    why_it_stays_a_guess: width changes on rotation and resize with no new navigation, so a server decision is stale while the reader is still on the page
    consequence: width informs asset selection, never markup structure; see decision:preference-signal-precedence
signals: decision:preference-signal-precedence
framework_owns:
  - reading whichever signal arrived, reporting absence rather than substituting a default, per api:user-preference-accessors
  - the Vary that each read implies, per policy:preference-vary-correctness
  - the Accept-CH and Critical-CH declaration when configured, per data:preference-hint-config
application_owns:
  - the CSS that answers the unoverridden case with no server involvement
  - the markup that consumes a resolved preference, such as the data-theme attribute of requirement:daisyui-integration
  - the api:server-action that records an explicit override, and the control that offers it
placement: an explicit override is persistent_mutation under policy:ui-state-placement, so it is a cookie written by a server action rather than client state
delivery_note: the resolved preference reaches the document through the head channel of decision:runtime-tag-injection only when the framework itself needs it; the theme attribute stays in the application shell
non_goals:
  - different text, data, or markup structure per preference; presentation defaults only, mirroring the no_cloaking rule of decision:bot-client-classification
  - a preference as an input to routing, authorization, or rate limiting, for the same unauthenticated-signal reason that rule gives
  - server-side responsive layout selection, which decision:preference-signal-precedence rejects outright
  - a framework-owned theme catalog, toggle component, or CSS; requirement:tailwind-css-integration and requirement:daisyui-integration stay application-owned
  - inferring a preference from anything not listed in decision:preference-signal-precedence
criteria:
  - a reader with no override and no hint receives a document whose first paint is correct, because CSS decided it, and the response carries no preference Vary
  - a reader with a recorded override receives that override applied in the first painted frame, in every browser, with no repaint
  - a Chromium client that sent a hint and has no override receives the hint applied, and the response varies on that hint
  - a Firefox or Safari client is never worse than the CSS-only result, and never blocked on a signal it cannot send
  - a response that read no preference carries no preference Vary, so a page with one representation stays cacheable
  - no response ever varies on viewport width, per policy:preference-vary-correctness
  - preference_hints disabled emits no Accept-CH, sends no Critical-CH, and leaves every accessor reporting absent
  - a classified bot under requirement:bot-synchronous-render receives the same text content as a browser, since only presentation defaults differ
```
