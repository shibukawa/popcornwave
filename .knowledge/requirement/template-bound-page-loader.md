title: Template Bound Page Loader
---
A page that loads its own data takes the route's inputs as component parameters and binds a loader's result to a name in the template, because system:tinybind v0.5.13 removed the typed `Load` this framework's scaffolds have been writing since the page tree shipped.

```yaml
source: system:tinybind v0.5.13, which retired the typed rung on 2026-08-14
what_was_removed:
  shape: func Load taking the route's inputs and returning the component's parameters
  went_with_it: the rung value, the registry's call path, and the leading context.Context that requirement:page-request-context spent a request getting
  upstream_ground: the three things it was for — deciding, combining, and failing — each have a spelling without it now
  the_premise_that_was_wrong_about_us: the removal is recorded as taken with no deprecation period because nothing downstream had adopted it; api:cli-init and api:cli-new both write one, so every project scaffolded by this framework has at least one
what_replaces_it:
  inputs: the component's own parameter list, which is the route's dynamic segments in order and then its query parameters
  data: an external declared in the template and implemented in the route package beside it
  binding: a value binding naming the result once, so a component rendering four fields of a record calls its loader once rather than four times
  shape: |
    external LoadUser(id: string): User

    export component Page(id: string): html {
      {val user = LoadUser(id)}
      <h1>{user.Name}</h1>
    }
the_context_survives_by_another_route:
  fact: a route-package external declaring a leading context.Context receives the request's, which routetree threads by scanning the directory the template sits in
  why_it_matters_here: this framework puts the database handle and the authenticated session on the request context per api:request-context-accessors, so a loader reading either needs one and most loaders read one
  consequence: requirement:page-request-context is answered rather than reopened; what changed is which declaration carries the context, not whether a page can reach it
  verified: the threading is in the tree compile and its reason is stated there; declaring one in this framework's own fixture is what closes it
the_check_moves_rather_than_disappearing:
  was: generation compared the typed function's result list against the component's parameter list
  now: the component's parameter list is checked against the route it serves — the leading parameters must be exactly the dynamic segments, in order
  so: a page still cannot silently disagree with its own route; what it can no longer disagree with is a second list that no longer exists
failing_is_better_than_it_was:
  hoisting: a value binding evaluates at the top of its block, so a loader that fails does so before the document shell has written a byte
  intent: an error carrying a redirect, a not-found, or a forbidden reaches api:error-renderer unwrapped, so the failure chooses the status
  what_that_beats: the typed rung could choose a status only because nothing had been written yet, and the same is now true on a streaming render rather than only on a buffered one
what_this_framework_must_change:
  scaffolds:
    api:cli-init: the discovered-pages preset writes a typed Load, which stops generating
    api:cli-new: offers three rungs and writes a typed Load for the middle one
    both: emit the component parameter, the external declaration, and the binding instead
  ladder: decision:page-rung-ladder, since the middle rung is what the scaffolds were offering
  fixture: internal/pagesfixture, whose route package declares one
  documentation: the page tree tutorial chapter and the discovered routing guide, in both locales, which teach the removed shape as the ordinary one
  catalog: requirement:page-request-context, whose whole subject was getting a context onto a declaration that no longer exists
what_stays:
  handler_rung: func Load taking the writer and the request, which owns its whole response and is what streaming, downloads, and conditional statuses need
  template_only: a page with no Go file at all, unchanged
  server_actions: untouched; an action is admitted by its own shape or its own declaration and never by the page entry point
as_built_2026_08_14:
  version: system:tinybind v0.5.13 adopted, and the tree is green on it
  fixture: the route package declares two externals and binds both, and the generated component calls LoadName with the request context threaded first, which is what proves the context survived the removal
  optional_kept: the absent-versus-zero case moved from the removed Load into a second loader, so the acceptance requirement:discovered-page-routing carries is still met by the same page
  scaffolds: api:cli-init writes the external, the binding and the Go implementation; api:cli-new renames its middle answer from a typed Load to a loader and writes both halves
  the_wizard_question_changed: from how much control to whether this page writes its own response, which is what the remaining two shapes differ on
  documentation: the discovered routing guide's ladder table and inputs section, and the page tree tutorial's rung explanation, both locales
  a_body_comment_is_content: the fixture's first migration put a // comment beside the binding and broke the single-root rule a component with a script block carries, because markup context has no comment syntax
acceptance:
  - a scaffolded page that loads data generates, serves, and renders without a Load function
  - its loader reads the request context, so a page listing the signed-in reader's own records is expressible
  - a loader that fails chooses the status, on a streaming render as well as a buffered one
  - a component whose leading parameters disagree with its route fails generation naming both
  - a page needing the whole response still writes the handler rung
  - a project holding a typed Load meets the module's diagnostic, which is the deliberate answer rather than a gap
the_scaffold_writes_both_halves:
  decided: 2026-08-14
  what: the template's external declaration and binding, and the Go function implementing it, beside each other
  why_not_the_declaration_alone: a declared external with no implementation does not compile, so a scaffold stopping there hands the author a project that fails to build
  shape_it_writes: the loader returning a value the component renders, taking the route's inputs, which is the same body the removed Load had with the entry point taken away
  consequence: a scaffolded page that loads data is two files again, as it was, and neither of them is an entry point
existing_pages_are_left_alone:
  decided: 2026-08-14
  no_migration: no rewriter, no check, and no diagnostic of this framework's own
  what_a_project_meets: the module's message, which names the file, the line, both shapes, and the replacement in one sentence
  recorded_in: decision:page-rung-ladder, with what the call costs and what it saves
```
