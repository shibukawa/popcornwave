title: Execute Only What A Live Response Transfers
---
A live-mode render should run the work its live bindings need and skip the rest, because today a reconnect re-executes a whole page to transfer two regions of it, and nothing outside the module can narrow that.

```yaml
owner: system:tinybind
status: accepted upstream 2026-07-31 as the highest-value item of the round and sequenced last, because it belongs with the generated plan work and its identity constraint needs its own design round; requirement:live-html-rendering ships paying it in full
priority: should
mechanism_today:
  reconstruction_is_execution: a live request runs the route handler, its layouts, and the page again, which is what lets a live binding see the arguments it saw before with no token and no server-held state
  consequence: every await boundary on that page runs again, and every byte it renders goes to io.Discard
  this_is_not_a_bug: the property is what makes decision:live-delivery-transport need no continuation; the cost is the price of it
when_it_bites:
  first_connection: once per page view that has a live boundary
  lifetime_rollover: once per client per html.live_max_duration, which policy:live-subscription-bounds deliberately keeps short — ten minutes by default
  disconnect: once per network drop, sleep, or proxy timeout
  deploy: once per open screen, all at once, which requirement:live-connection-recovery already names as the heaviest event this design has
  proportional_to: the page's own work, not the live region's; a dashboard with one live gauge beside six database-backed panels pays for all seven
what_it_costs_here:
  unit: page executions per second, which is the number capacity planning has to use, because connections are cheap and executions reach the database
  steady_state: one execution per client per lifetime, so N screens cost N/600 executions per second at the default
  example: examples/live_render runs LoadRoomTitle on every reconnect and discards it, which is the shape of the waste in miniature
  where_it_lands: behind the proxy, on the same dependencies the document render uses, so it looks like a page-load spike rather than like streaming load
workaround_difficulty:
  possible: no, not from here
  why: the framework hands htmlbind a chain of fragments whose parameters are already bound; which ops a plan executes is inside the generated plan, and nothing in the public surface selects a subset
  what_the_framework_can_do:
    lengthen_the_lifetime: fewer reconnects, at the price of the authorization re-check, deploy rollover, and rebalancing the bound exists to buy
    jitter: already applied, and it spreads the steady state without reducing it
    idle_close: reduces executions for tabs nobody is watching, and adds one when they come back
  what_an_application_can_do: keep live boundaries on pages whose other work is cheap, which is guidance rather than a mechanism
  none_of_that_narrows_it: every mitigation trades one cost for another; only the module can skip work
proposed_shape:
  slice: generation knows statically which values feed a live binding's arguments, so a live-mode plan can execute that slice and skip every op whose output is discarded
  entry: a variant of the plan rather than a new mechanism, since a plan already carries its ops
  bound: it can only skip what the live bindings do not read, so a live binding whose argument comes from an awaited value still pays for that value
acceptance:
  - a live-mode render of a page with one live boundary and several await boundaries runs the live boundary's inputs and none of the others
  - the ids the sliced render allocates match the ones the document render allocated, or the resume contract breaks
  - a page whose live binding depends on an awaited value still evaluates that value
  - a chain with no live boundary is unaffected
```
