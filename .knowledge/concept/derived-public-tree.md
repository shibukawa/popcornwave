title: Derived Public Tree
---
The authored public directory stops being the served tree; a build-produced dist/public tree, plus the metadata describing it, becomes the only thing embedded and served.

```yaml
today: requirement:public-asset-delivery embeds and serves the authored tree, and flow:public-asset-build only adds .zstd siblings beside its files
why_it_stops_working:
  conversion_drops_a_source: a png converted to webp, a css minified in place, and a ts compiled to js all leave the authored file with no reason to ship, and an overlay or an in-place write cannot express a deletion
  one_url_many_representations: an additional avif exists for the same URL and is chosen per request, which the authored tree has no place to hold
  outputs_outnumber_sources: a build emits a source map and a css companion no authored file names
  cleanup: a derived tree is rebuilt and therefore self-pruning; a sibling written into the authored tree is stale forever, which policy:generated-artifacts already carries as an unsolved shape for requirement:component-asset-extraction
two_producers:
  tree_walk: extension-driven work needing no template reference, such as a css minify, a url() rewrite inside a stylesheet, or a verbatim copy
  generation_hook: work that changes a URL a template names, so the attribute value has to follow it, per requirement:derived-asset-pipeline
  shared_conversions: both can be the first to need one image converted, so the conversion is keyed by source and settings and its outcome is shared rather than repeated
  union: both write into one tree and one data:public-asset-manifest; two producers claiming one output path with different bytes is a build error
invariants:
  - the authored tree is input only and is never served in any mode, per decision:derived-tree-development
  - every served byte has a manifest entry, so nothing is discovered by walking at request time
  - the tree and its manifest are embedded together, so an embedded tree cannot disagree with its metadata
  - a project registering no transform gets a byte-identical copy of its authored tree and behaves as it does today
relation_to_component_assets:
  same_tree: requirement:component-asset-extraction writes generated component styles and scripts, and they land here like any other derived file
  different_axis: that requirement takes content out of a template; this one takes a file the template points at
```
