title: Session Storage and Authentication Boundary
---
The session package stores typed per-browser state and knows nothing about login; popcornweb/plugin/auth decides who the browser is, how well that is proved, and how long it stays true.

```yaml
session_owns:
  browser_identity: one opaque token, its hash, and the cookie carrying it
  storage: typed slots declared by Go type, per api:session-registry
  tier: what the client may read and write, and where the bytes live, per requirement:state-storage-tiers
  placement: resolved per slot at registration and per record at creation, per decision:slot-declared-placement
  mechanics: encode, decode, size bounds, atomic replacement, revocation, and enforcement of whatever expiry it is handed
auth_owns:
  user_identity: the account, data:external-identity, and the method that proved it
  assurance: the concept:assurance-axes strength and freshness pair, and api:assurance-guard
  lifetime: every duration, per decision:session-lifetime-owned-by-auth
  events: when a session is created, rotated, and destroyed
  request_authentication: derived in its own middleware at SlotAuthentication, from its own slot, so a cart never looks like a login
relation:
  shape: plugin/auth registers one slot beside the application's own, holding data:session-assurance-state
  storage_privilege: none; its slot is stored exactly like any other
  driver_privilege: it is the caller that creates, rotates, and destroys, per api:session-manager
  consequence: an application importing no authentication still has typed session storage, with no framework lifetime, which decision:framework-owned-session-extension made true of the code as well as of the design
moved_out_of_session:
  fields: ttl, idle_timeout, renewal_interval, authenticated_at, and authentication_method
  reason: each answers how well and how recently the subject was proved, and a store holding a shopping cart has no basis to answer it
  effect: data:session-runtime-config declares placement and cookie policy only, and data:authentication-runtime-config declares the durations
stayed_in_session:
  - the token, its entropy, and its cookie attributes, because they identify the browser rather than the user
  - the policy:csrf-protection secret, because a state-changing request is dangerous by virtue of carrying a cookie, not by virtue of being logged in
  - revocation, because only the store knows whether it can revoke, per decision:cookie-session-storage
question_test:
  storage: where do these bytes live, who may read them, and how big may they be
  auth: is this browser the user it claims, how strongly, how recently, and for how much longer
  rule: a field answering the second question does not belong to the session package, whatever the record it currently sits in
```
