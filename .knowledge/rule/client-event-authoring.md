title: Signal Authoring Rules
---
A registered handler is a capability the page hands the server, and a signal runs on the server's clock rather than on a gesture, so what may be published and what may be sent are both narrower questions than what the channel can express.

```yaml
source: requirement:client-signal-registry and requirement:signal-forwarding-seam
upstream: system:tinybind v0.5.3 states the payload-trust boundary and the no-code-transfer obligation normatively; what is here is the authoring consequence and what this framework adds
inherits: rule:live-boundary-authoring, whose premise carries over — an effect arrives while the user is reading or typing, not because they asked
a_handler_is_a_capability:
  model: the registry is the published set of entry points a render may invoke, so registering a name grants something and the question is always what
  the_name_is_checked_and_the_payload_is_not: matching a name is the cheap half; what a handler is willing to do with arbitrary payload is the actual grant
  narrow_by_closing_over_the_answer:
    tightest: a handler taking no payload and closing over its behaviour, so the server can say only when
    looser: a handler whose payload is a closed set it validates — an id it looks up, one of a few known states
    loosest: a handler taking a URL, a selector, a key path, or markup, which grants whatever that argument can name
    example: a finish handler navigating to a route the page already knew grants one navigation; the same handler navigating to a payload URL grants navigation anywhere, and the difference is invisible in the name
  ask_at_registration: what the worst payload could make this do, since the payload is the part nobody reviews later
  close_over_the_constant_read_the_varying:
    why_it_is_not_a_contradiction: a registration is keyed on the route pattern, so one registration serves room/2 and room/3 and a module registers once for whichever arrived first; a handler closing over that instance's id is silently wrong for the next
    rule: close over what is constant for the route, and read what varies per instance from the payload
    the_instance_belongs_to_the_signal: the source emitting from room 3 knows it is room 3, from the same execution that rendered the page
    the_url_case: a destination differing per instance has to travel in the payload, which is exactly when the supplied navigate handler is the right registration — the origin check is what makes a payload-carried URL safe, rather than avoiding one
    smell: a handler naming an id, a room, or a path that came from the page it was registered on rather than from the signal it received
    not_solved_by_filtering: the live connection already carries only the current page's signals, so a dispatch test repairs nothing; a handler holding a stale id is wrong at the moment it was written
never_publish_a_general_mechanism:
  forbidden: a handler that evaluates, imports, or dispatches by a string the payload supplied — eval, new Function, a method name looked up on an object, a selector-and-method pair, or innerHTML of payload text
  why: this is the loosest argument surface there is, and it collapses the capability table into the script channel the wire refuses; policy:security-response-headers enforces script-src self with no nonce, and a handler running what the payload names removes that by the application's own hand
  normative_upstream: the obligation is stated on the wire contract as resolving a name against your own table and nothing else, called out separately because a dynamic fallback reaches the same code execution by another route
  test: whether adding a server-side name could change what the browser does without editing any application JavaScript; if it can, one registration granted everything
  read_it_off_the_page: the model's property is that every effect a render can cause is enumerable from the application's source, and a dispatching handler makes that enumeration a lie
fan_out_is_the_leak_to_watch:
  premise: policy:live-subscription-bounds tells applications that sharing one upstream across subscriptions is the application's job inside the source, so the framework recommends the shape that carries this hazard
  consequence: a source fanning one upstream out emits every signal to every subscription, so a payload meant for one user reaches all of them
  contrast_with_deliveries: a shared delivery is usually shared data by construction, where an instruction is usually addressed to someone
  rule: a signal carrying anything user-specific comes from a per-subscription source, and a shared source emits only what every subscriber may see
  not_enforceable: nothing can tell the two apart, which is why this is a rule rather than a check
payload_is_data:
  first_party_but_still_data: it comes from the application's own server, which is not a reason to write it into the document as markup or into a URL without checking
  concretely: not assigned to innerHTML, not handed to a DOM sink that parses markup, not used to build a selector or a URL without the caller's own escaping
  what_is_guaranteed: valid JSON escaped for a script context as well as a JSON one, transferred verbatim with no field inspected; what a callback does with the parsed value afterwards is outside every guarantee
  no_projection_happens: a recover clause projects an error down to public fields because the module defined that type, and a signal payload is a struct the author named, so a server-only identifier or an internal error string placed in one reaches the browser
  never_a_second_origin: a handler must not forward payload contents to another host, since the channel would become an exfiltration path with the page's own credentials
  registration_is_where_review_happens: a name and its handler are read together in the page's source, and the payload arrives months later from a row nobody is looking at
enhancement_only:
  rule: a page whose correctness depends on a signal firing is mis-designed
  why: requirement:unified-update-runtime holds that the runtime optimizes behaviour the markup already has, and a signal has no markup fallback — scripting off, a dropped connection, a handler registered too late, and best-effort delivery all produce nothing
  upstream_states_the_delivery_half: not queued, not replayed, not acknowledged, so an instruction that must be seen exactly once does not belong here
  no_first_paint_channel: the document entry forwards nothing, so a signal emitted during the document render is not delivered and not held; a toast that must appear on first load is rendered, not signalled
  concretely: a job page must still tell a reloading user that the job finished, from the render; the signal saves them the reload
effects_repeat_per_connection:
  why: requirement:live-connection-recovery makes reconnect the steady state, and a reconnect re-executes the page, so a source deciding from stored state emits again
  rule: a handler converges rather than accumulates, and a source decides from state it can re-read
  wrong: a handler appending a row per signal, which duplicates the list on every lifetime rollover; a source deciding from a flag it set in memory, which does not survive the re-execution
  right: a handler that sets a state, and a source that reads the job row
an_unchanged_delivery_is_not_an_arrival:
  fact: the server suppresses a delivery whose validator matches, and the client leaves an identical one alone
  consequence: a delivery_applied handler reads whether the DOM changed rather than that a record arrived
  analytics: a delivery count is a count of changes plus reconnect noise, never of what the source produced
when_a_navigation_is_legitimate:
  yes: the page's reason to exist ended — the job finished and the result lives elsewhere, the resource was deleted, access was revoked, the session ended
  no: new content is available, which is a link the user follows when they are ready
  no_either: a navigation standing in for a render, where the source could have delivered the finished state into the boundary it already owns
  test: whether the user would be surprised to still be on this page a moment later; if staying is reasonable, the answer is a link
  standard: WCAG 3.2.5 treats an automatic change of context as something to request rather than impose, and this is the strongest change of context the framework can produce
  what_it_destroys: rule:live-boundary-authoring keeps a form control out of a live subtree because a delivery destroys typing; a navigation destroys typing everywhere on the page, including in the form correctly placed outside the boundary
one_response_leaves_together:
  fact: one live response carries every live boundary of the page
  consequence: a signal whose handler leaves the page ends the connection for all of them and takes the page with it
  authoring: a signal that can end the page is a decision about the page, so it belongs in a source whose scope is the page rather than in one of several equal widgets
what_a_handler_may_not_do:
  rewrite_framework_attributes: the boundary fences, ids, and manifest state belong to the runtime, per the rule api:client-update-api already states for its own callers
  block: a handler runs inside the apply path, so slow work belongs behind a task
  assume_it_runs: a page may load with the runtime disabled, so an author feature-detects the namespace
  depend_on_another_handler: registration order is not a contract, and several handlers may share one name
announcement_stays_the_authors:
  unchanged: rule:live-boundary-authoring owns whether a delivery is announced, and a signal does not change the answer
  navigation: announces through the polite region requirement:update-navigation-continuity maintains, which is the document-load behaviour rather than a new one
  not_an_alert: a screen whose job finished says so by becoming the result page, not by interrupting
```
