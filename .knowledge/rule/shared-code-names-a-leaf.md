title: Code Compiled Into Both Builds Names A Shared Leaf
---
A file carrying no build tag is compiled into both builds, so every framework symbol it names must live in a shared leaf. Naming pw there puts the whole net/http runtime into the fasthttp binary through one import.

```yaml
status: accepted
serves: requirement:second-build-feature-parity
leaves: pwconfig, pwdatabase, pwsession, pwobservability, pwextension, pwratelimit, pwbrowser, pwruntime, sessionconfig, contrib/otel/trace
why_it_is_not_obvious:
  file_granularity: a build tag excludes a whole file, so the unit is the file and not the call
  transport_free_code_looks_safe: the offending file names no writer and no request, which is exactly why it carries no tag and exactly why the author does not think about transports while writing it
  net_http_build_passes: both spellings resolve there, so nothing reports it until someone builds the other target
  publishing_in_pw_alone_is_the_defect: the capability is present and correct; only its address is wrong
worked_example:
  what: a live source is iter.Seq2 over values and signals, taking no request and writing to no response
  wrong: pw.NamedSignal in examples/live_render/handlers/sources.go
  effect: the fasthttp build of that example linked pw, which had been the branch's central invariant
  fix: constructors moved to pwruntime beside the prefix both live loops reserve; pw re-exports true aliases
  found_by: go list -tags fasthttp -deps after a merge, not by any test
enforcement:
  today: pwconfig/split_test.go asserts package-level containment for the framework's own packages
  gap: nothing asserts it for application-shaped code, which is where this class lands
  guard_shape: an external test package importing the leaf and nothing else, so a symbol moved back into pw stops compiling rather than resolving under the other name and passing
  instance: pwruntime/signal_test.go
publishing_rule:
  - a capability an untagged file can need is defined in a leaf and re-exported from pw, never the reverse
  - types cross as true aliases, for the reason data:loaded-configuration records: a registry keyed by reflect.Type sees a defined type as a different one and every lookup silently misses
  - a generic function cannot be aliased in Go, so pw forwards it; only types must be aliases
```
