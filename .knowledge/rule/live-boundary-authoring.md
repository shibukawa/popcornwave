title: Live Boundary Authoring Rules
---
A live boundary renders output, not input, because its subtree is replaced on the server's clock and nothing warns the user first.

```yaml
status: the form-control diagnostic is enforced by system:tinybind generation; the rest is authoring guidance flow:template-generation cannot check
source: requirement:live-html-rendering
problem:
  replace_destroys: replacing a subtree discards the value of an input, the caret, the selection, and the element identity the browser attached that state to
  no_user_signal: a navigation is something the user asked for; a delivery arrives while the user is typing
  frequency: once every few seconds rather than once per navigation
enforced:
  reported: form, input, textarea, select, and contenteditable inside a live clause's primary subtree, including nested if, for, slot default, and nested boundary subtrees
  severity: a generation error, because the failure is silent loss of something the user typed
  not_in_fallback_or_recover: those subtrees are rendered once and never replaced by a delivery
authoring_shape:
  pattern: the form stays outside the boundary and the live data goes inside it
  reason: the input's DOM stays stable while the output re-renders, which is the split the protocol can guarantee
not_enforced:
  focus: a link or button inside the boundary loses focus when its subtree is replaced, and no static rule can forbid a focusable element in output
  scroll: the boundary's own scroll position, and the page position relative to a boundary that changes height
  media: a playing video or audio element restarts
  animation: a CSS animation or transition restarts from its initial state
  handling: state the exposure rather than hide it; a client runtime may restore focus if it chooses
source_contract:
  whole_state: a delivery carries the current state of the region, not an increment, so the source owns any accumulation the screen shows
  no_mutation: a source must not mutate a value it already yielded, because the boundary renders from the scope that value was written into
  no_carry: the primary subtree cannot read the previous delivery
  individually_meaningful_events: a source whose values must each be seen is the wrong shape here, because a fast source coalesces; yield the accumulated state instead
  context: the leading context.Context is mandatory, and a source that ignores it outlives its subscription
  await_inside: an await clause inside a live primary subtree re-runs its work on every delivery, which is legal and usually a mistake
announcement:
  owner: the author, because only the author knows whether an update is worth interrupting for
  timer_paced: a gauge, clock, or dashboard is not announced; a changing number on the server's cadence makes a page unusable with a screen reader
  arrival_paced: a chat log, notification list, or feed uses role log, where the arrival is the information
  assertive: essentially never correct for content
  placement: the attribute goes on an element that survives a delivery, meaning a wrapper the author writes around the boundary, never inside the replaced subtree
  granularity: a screen reader announces from DOM mutations, so replacing a whole log re-announces every message; this is why finer operations are an accessibility concern and not only a bandwidth one
escaping: policy:template-escaping and the context checks apply to a delivery exactly as they apply to a settled boundary, and no delivery carries script
```
