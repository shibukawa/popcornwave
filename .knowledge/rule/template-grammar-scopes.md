title: Template Grammar Scopes
---
One shared grammar covers the concept:template-source-dialects header and control forms, three body grammars embed into it, and every scope name is fixed here so a theme and a semantic token layer agree.

```yaml
status: implemented at tools/vscode/syntaxes, per decision:extension-in-repository
consumer: requirement:template-syntax-highlighting
languages:
  pw-html: source.pw.html, from *.pw.html
  pw-sql: source.pw.sql, from *.pw.sql
  pw-dynamo: source.pw.dynamo, from *.pw.dynamo
shared_grammar:
  scope: source.pw
  included_by: all three, as a repository include rather than as an injection
  bound_to_no_language: it has no file extension of its own and is contributed for its scope only
header_scopes:
  keyword.control.import.pw: package, module, import, as
  storage.type.pw: type, record, enum, external
  storage.modifier.pw: export, async, live
  keyword.declaration.pw: component, statement
  entity.name.function.pw: the PascalCase declaration name
  variable.parameter.pw: a parameter name before its colon, and an annotation argument name
  variable.other.property.pw: a record field name, and a field read after a dot
  support.type.pw: the primitive type names, whose list system:tinybind owns and this rule does not restate
  entity.name.type.pw: a PascalCase type reference, including the argument of a generic output type
  support.type.output.pw: html, the sql and dynamo output prefixes, and the opaque output types
  string.quoted.double.pw: an import path or an annotation argument value
  entity.name.tag.annotation.pw: "@name in an @name(key: \"value\") annotation"
  comment.line.pw and comment.block.pw: header comments
body_scopes:
  punctuation.section.embedded.pw: the "{" and "}" of a template expression
  meta.embedded.expression.pw: the expression between them
  keyword.control.pw: if, else, for, in, await, fallback, recover, and the "/" of a closing form
  keyword.operator.pw: an expression operator, including the "=" of an await binding
  support.function.builtin.pw: the intrinsic calls RawHTML, RawCSS, RawJavaScript, and JsonForScript, whose results are opaque output types rather than values
  entity.name.function.pw: any other call in an expression
  variable.other.pw: an identifier in an expression
  constant.character.escape.pw: "{{ and }}, whose content is literal text"
html_scopes:
  entity.name.tag.slot.pw: the reserved slot element, which is template syntax rather than markup
  entity.name.tag.component.pw: a PascalCase tag, which is a component reference rather than an element
  markup: every other tag, attribute, and value keeps the ordinary .html scope names, so an installed HTML theme colors them
dynamo_scopes:
  keyword.other.clause.pw:
    set: table, key, and filter, which the parser recognizes by name only so it can reject it
    closed: the body grammar has no other clause; limit, index, and consistent read are driver options at the call site and never appear here
    why_it_matters: coloring an invented keyword as a clause tells the author it exists, which is the one failure decision:textmate-grammar-first does not tolerate
  entity.name.table.pw: the logical table name a table clause states
  variable.other.attribute.pw: an attribute name in a key clause
  keyword.operator.logical.pw and keyword.operator.comparison.pw: and, and the sort key predicates =, <, <=, >, >=, between, begins_with
embedding:
  pw-html: the body is meta.embedded.block.html, with a local tag layer ahead of text.html.basic so an attribute value can still hold an expression
  pw-sql: the body is meta.embedded.block.sql over source.sql, with the SQL literal and comment guards matched first
  pw-dynamo: the body is a local clause grammar, because it is not SQL
  raw_text: script and style content is meta.embedded.block.js or meta.embedded.block.css, matched ahead of the generic tag rule so the gate below applies
  embeddedLanguages: maps meta.embedded.block.html to html, meta.embedded.block.sql to sql, and meta.embedded.expression.pw to the dialect itself
rules:
  - a scope name here is the contract; renaming one is a breaking change for a theme and for the requirement:pw-language-server token layer
  - the shared grammar is defined once and included three times; a copy per dialect is the drift decision:extension-in-repository exists to prevent
  - an SQL string literal, quoted identifier, comment, or dollar-quoted region never enters the expression scope, because the sqlbind parser does not treat it as template syntax
  - script and style content follows the tinybind raw-text insertion gate rather than the unconditional brace grammar; a brace opens an expression only in a tight shape, is content when preceded by "$", and a closing brace there is always content
  - a dynamo body carries no SQL scope at all; naming it source.sql would offer wrong completions and wrong comment toggling
  - an unrecognized brace form falls back to plain text and never to an invalid scope, per decision:textmate-grammar-first
  - a declaration rule spans its signature and its body, so the body's closing brace closes the declaration and the next declaration starts clean
  - a rule whose body is a brace block matches through the opening brace, because an end pattern that can fire before the block is entered leaves the block unscoped
drift_guard:
  fixture: every .pw.html, .pw.sql, and .pw.dynamo source in the repository, tokenized against a committed snapshot
  dynamo_gap: the repository has no production .pw.dynamo source, so the dialect's snapshot coverage comes from a grammar-only fixture under the extension's own test tree
  failure: a token sequence changing without an intended grammar edit fails the pull request, naming the first differing line
  refresh: an intended change regenerates the snapshot and the diff is reviewed
  formatting: the requirement:template-formatting adoption commit regenerates it too, because reformatted sources tokenize differently
  upstream: a system:tinybind version bump that changes concept:template-source-dialects requires a grammar review in the same change
```
