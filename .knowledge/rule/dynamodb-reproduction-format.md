title: DynamoDB Reproduction Format
---
The rerun snippet is the captured request body handed to the AWS CLI unchanged, because the body already is the request.

```yaml
form: "aws dynamodb <operation> --cli-input-json '<the captured body>'"
source: decision:dynamodb-observability-seam captures the body on its way to the wire
why_it_is_exact:
  here: the protocol is one JSON document per operation, so the reproduction is the observed request rather than a reconstruction of it
  contrast: rule:query-reproduction-format has to rebuild a statement and rebind its parameters, and states why it must never inline a literal
  consequence: there is no equivalent hazard; a snippet that differs from what ran cannot be produced by copying what ran
prohibition:
  no_reassembly: never rebuild the body from parsed fields, because a round trip through the framework's own model is exactly where a difference would enter
  no_endpoint: the snippet names no endpoint, region, profile, or credential; the operator supplies those, and policy:query-log-safety already forbids emitting them
  no_framework_tables: a rule:framework-owned-tables request produces no record and therefore no snippet
gating:
  requires: bind values on, since the body carries key values and item attributes and is the same class of data
  without_it: the record keeps operation, table, timing, capacity, and counts, which is enough to see that a request was slow without seeing what it said
  omit_when_truncated: a body that hit its bound produces no snippet, because a truncated JSON document is not runnable
rules:
  - the snippet is quoted for a shell and escapes control characters, matching what rule:query-reproduction-format requires of its own output
  - a write operation snippet is marked as one, so an operator does not paste a PutItem into a production account without noticing
  - the snippet is diagnostic output and the framework never runs it
