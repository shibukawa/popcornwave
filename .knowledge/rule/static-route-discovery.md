title: Static Route Discovery
---
Routes used for generated OpenAPI must be statically discoverable in the same Go package as their handlers.

```yaml
required:
  - Handle or HandleFunc registration recognized by requirement:httpbinder-extensible-route-analysis
  - literal route pattern
  - Go 1.22 method-and-path form preferred
  - named, inline, or ServeHTTP handler body visible to system:tinybind
  - explicit pw.Parse, WriteHTML, WriteAPI, NewStream, and problem calls in the handler body
unsupported:
  - dynamically concatenated patterns
  - registration APIs without a built-in or configured analysis adapter
  - cross-package handler bodies whose types cannot be inspected
consequence: unsupported routes may run but are absent or incomplete in generated OpenAPI and must fail api:cli-check
out_of_scope:
  page_routes: a concept:page-tree route is generated rather than discovered, so it is neither analyzed here nor reported here, and it stays out of the OpenAPI document by design per decision:dual-router-coexistence
  action_endpoints: api:page-action-endpoint registrations are generated for the same reason
  not_automatic: a generated registry is an ordinary registration site to anything that reads it, so the exclusion is maintained by flow:page-route-generation rather than implied by the page tree being generated
  generated_sources: discovery skips a file whose header prefix it was told to recognize, so api:cli-generate registers the Popcorn Web prefix and its own output stops being an input, per decision:page-render-binding
```
