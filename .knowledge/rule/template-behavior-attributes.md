title: Template Behavior Attributes
---
Every reserved attribute that attaches behaviour to an element, what each one lowers to, and what the element does when no runtime is there, so an author reads one place to know whether a gesture survives scripting being off.

```yaml
source: decision:event-binding-attribute-spelling, decision:action-entry-point-selection, and the user's attribute-alignment question 2026-08-11
exactly_one_signal_distinguishes_the_two_sides:
  fact: a handler name resolves either in a component's JavaScript or against a Go symbol, and nothing in a name says which
  therefore: the attribute name differs, or the value form differs, and one of the two must
  a_different_name_both_quoted: what ships for the server half today, and what this catalog recommends
  a_shared_name_with_different_value_forms: an alternative decision:event-binding-attribute-spelling records
  same_name_and_same_form: not expressible; the only remaining signals are a resolution order, which is silent, and identifier casing, which decides which side of the network code runs on from a letter
server_side:
  attribute: server-action, whose value is a static name of an exported Go function in the route package
  owner: system:tinybind, which reserves and lowers it
  form_element:
    emits: method=post, a hidden selector carrying hash and name, the CSRF field the module inserts because the method is now unsafe, and the runtime attribute
    no_action_attribute: none is written; a form declaring none submits to the document URL, which already holds this page's path parameters and whose query a POST keeps
    registers: POST on the page's own path beside its GET, so a hand-registered POST there is a startup panic rather than a conflict anyone was warned about
    without_a_runtime: a native POST reaching the handler, answered by the 303 of requirement:scriptless-action-forms
    with_one: intercepted, posted, and the response applied per requirement:action-response-update
  submit_button_inside_a_form:
    emits: formaction carrying that handler's selector, plus the runtime attribute
    why_formaction: it is the native per-button override, so one form dispatches several handlers with no runtime
    precedence: the selector is read from the query before the body, so a button's override wins over the form's own field rather than coexisting with it
    without_a_runtime: works
  bare_element:
    emits: the runtime attribute alone
    without_a_runtime: nothing happens, and no lowering can change that, because nothing in the markup invokes a button outside a form
    covers: a button with no enclosing form, and any other element
  anchor: the action check runs before the navigation interception, so an element that is both a link and an action mutates rather than navigates
client_side:
  attribute: an on-prefixed hyphenated name carrying the event, whose value is a static name resolved per decision:component-handler-namespace
  reserved_only_inside_a_component_declaring_a_block: elsewhere it is emitted unread, so the marker never appears where no namespace could have resolved it
  not_matched: a second hyphen, so on-my-event stays an ordinary custom-element attribute
  refused: a computed value, and two of the same event on one element
  the_name_is_free: the event attribute context rule of system:tinybind excludes a hyphenated on-name from its handler roster explicitly, so claiming it collides with nothing and needs no change to that rule
  distinct_from_the_platform_attribute: onclick keeps meaning inline JavaScript, unchanged, which is what keeps this additive
  any_element: inside a component declaring a script block, bound at mount from that instance's namespace
  outside_one: a generation error, since no namespace could resolve the name
  without_a_runtime: nothing happens, always, because a client handler has no markup fallback by definition; requirement:unified-update-runtime calls this the shape a page's correctness must not depend on
both_on_one_element:
  example: a form carrying a server action and a submit handler beside it
  settled: 2026-08-11; the handler runs and the action follows, and no cancellation channel exists
  the_question_it_dissolves: which value or call cancels the action, which had four candidates and no cheap answer
  raised_by: the user, observing that writing both is niche enough to refuse outright
  narrowed_rather_than_refused:
    what_refusing_the_pair_would_also_kill: an analytics call, a spinner, and a handler adding a field before the submit, none of which cancel anything and none of which are wrong
    so: the pair is allowed and defined as running both, which removes the cancellation question with less collateral than a generation error would
  gating_belongs_to_the_programmatic_path:
    shape: put only the client handler on the element, and call the action from it through the actions namespace of requirement:action-invocation-runtime
    example: a handler that awaits a confirmation dialog and calls actions.Delete only if it was accepted
    why_it_is_better_than_a_cancel_signal: the control flow is written where a reader sees it, rather than implied by a returned value that a helper cannot produce
    it_costs_nothing_new: the stub was already decided for calling an action without a gesture, so this is a use of it rather than an addition
  what_the_framework_already_answers_instead:
    validation: the platform tier of concept:interaction-cost-ladder covers the echo with constraint attributes and no JavaScript, and requirement:action-response-update makes the server's 4xx regions the authority
    confirmation: a confirmation page is the shape that survives scripting being off, which is what requirement:classic-web-acceptance asks a project to keep
    pending_state: the busy marker, not a handler
  ordering: the handler is awaited and the action follows, so a handler that adds a field before the submit still works
  a_throwing_handler_stops_it: an unhandled error means a broken handler, and mutating after one is the wrong default; it is reported, and it is a failure rather than a choice
how_both_sides_are_found_at_runtime:
  chosen: one scan of the incoming region, binding a listener per declared event, for the server side and the client side alike
  decided: with the user 2026-08-11, replacing an earlier split where the server side was delegated from the document
  why_one_walk: the client side cannot be delegated, because its namespace comes from a dynamic import and a handler cannot preventDefault after an await; once that walk exists, the server side rides it for nothing
  the_event_is_emitted_rather_than_inferred:
    shape: one prefixed attribute listing the events the element binds, so the runtime listens for what the markup says instead of deciding from the element kind
    decided_by_generation: a form gets submit and a button gets click, so this is an emitted detail and not an authoring surface, and it opens no trigger model
    selector: one indexed querySelectorAll over that attribute finds every behaviour-bearing element of either kind, and the sibling attributes say whether the answer is a handler name, an address, or both
    grammar: the comma-and-colon list parseScopeCatalog already reads, so nothing new is parsed
  one_listener_per_event_rather_than_one_per_behaviour:
    why: two listeners on one element run in registration order, and the client one waits for a module while the server one does not, so a separately bound action could run before the validation meant to gate it
    shape: one listener per declared event, which awaits the client handler and then issues the action
    gain: ordering stops depending on registration and becomes a property of the listener, which is what makes a handler that adds a field before the submit work at all
    still_true_with_no_cancellation: two listeners would fire independently and the action would not wait, so the reason for one listener is the await rather than a refusal to read
    handler_not_resolved_yet: nothing is intercepted at all and the markup's own behaviour proceeds, which is a native POST for a form and nothing for a bare element
    why_that_is_the_safe_side: skipping the interception loses a validation the server repeats anyway, where issuing the action without it would submit past a gate the author wrote
  what_delegation_would_have_bought: markup inserted by application JavaScript rather than by the server, which now needs an explicit rescan call
  why_that_is_acceptable: the server owns the markup in this model, and api:client-update-api already expects an author building markup by hand to use the surface rather than the conventions
  what_it_additionally_fixes: a document-level listener does not cross a closed shadow root and closest does not either, so delegation was quietly wrong for the custom elements the authored-islands tier of concept:interaction-cost-ladder is built on
  the_asymmetry_that_remains: a server action needs only an address, which markup can carry and which therefore also works before the runtime arrives; a client handler needs a live function, which only a resolved module has
the_server_side_is_three_layers_rather_than_one:
  generation_assigns_the_address: the symbol resolves and the endpoint hash is computed, which is what api:page-action-endpoint already ships and is the identifier a lowering writes
  markup_performs_it_unaided: a form carries a real action and method, so the browser submits without help, per requirement:scriptless-action-forms
  the_runtime_optimizes_it: requirement:action-invocation-runtime intercepts and fetches so regions come back instead of a whole page
  reading: the three are layers and not alternatives; the runtime consumes the address generation assigned, and it improves a submission the markup could already perform
  where_the_client_side_differs: it has no middle layer at all, because no markup expresses running a function in the browser
behaviour_changes_when_the_runtime_arrives:
  fact: a gesture before the runtime has installed its listeners takes the markup's own path, and the same gesture afterwards takes the intercepted one
  named_by: the user 2026-08-11, comparing React server components, where a form works as a native post before hydration and as a fetch after it
  not_a_defect: both paths reach the same handler and the handler branches on one predicate per requirement:action-response-update, so the two responses are by design rather than by accident
  the_two_windows_degrade_differently:
    server_action: works throughout; before the runtime it is a full POST answered by the 303, which is slower and correct, and afterwards it is regions
    client_handler: does nothing before its module resolves, because no markup expresses running a function
  authoring_consequence: a control whose only job is a client handler is rendered disabled and enabled by its setup, where a control carrying a server action needs nothing, since its early behaviour is the correct one
  what_the_runtime_actually_buys: not the round trip, which both paths pay, but the document parse it avoids and the scroll, focus, typing and client state requirement:unified-update-runtime preserves across the swap
  deterministic_addresses_are_where_this_beats_the_comparison: system:tinybind records that React action ids are non-deterministic per build, so a page held open across a deploy can post to an id the server no longer knows; the hash of api:page-action-endpoint has no build salt, so a stale page still submits somewhere the server recognizes
what_none_of_these_do:
  no_target: the regions an action rewrites are chosen in Go, per requirement:action-response-update, so no attribute names a swap target
  no_payload_assembly: a form sends its fields and a bare element sends nothing, so no attribute decides what is transmitted
  no_arguments: a handler name is a name, never a call, since an argument list is an expression to evaluate at bind time
  no_expression: an expression on any of these is a generation error, because the symbol must resolve at generation
reading_a_per_instance_value_in_a_handler:
  shape: the author renders it into an attribute and the handler reads it, since decision:component-handler-namespace records that a script block can hold no interpolation
  put_it_on_the_bound_element: a data attribute on the button, read from the event's currentTarget when it fires, rather than on the component root read once at mount
  why: the markup is the source of truth, so a delta that re-rendered the row updates the attribute and the next event reads the new value, where a value taken at mount goes stale under a swap below the marked root
  it_is_the_same_shape_the_server_side_uses: the lowered action attribute is read off the element at event time too, so nothing new is being introduced
  twenty_rows_one_handler: each button carries its own value and one function serves all of them, which is the close over the constant and read the varying rule of rule:client-event-authoring applied one layer down
  the_other_granularity: making the row itself the component, so each row is its own instance and its setup closes over its own value; both are correct and the choice is how small a component is
  values_are_strings: a dataset read returns text whatever the Go type was, so a number is parsed by the handler
  escaping_is_ordinary: a data attribute is on neither the URL roster nor the event roster, so an insertion there takes the ordinary attribute escaping of the template grammar
authoring_shorthand:
  a_mutation_that_must_work_without_script: put server-action on a form
  a_mutation_that_may_need_a_runtime: put server-action on a button, and accept that scripting off does nothing
  browser_only_behaviour: put the on-prefixed attribute on the element and the function in the component's script block
  both: write both attributes on the same element
```
