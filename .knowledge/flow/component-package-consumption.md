title: Component Package Consumption
---
Installing a concept:component-package is one line in data:project-config, plus a Register call when it serves routes; generation links it, migration creates its tables, and nothing is copied into the project tree.

```yaml
flow:
  trigger: an entry added to the data:project-config packages array, by hand or by api:cli-package
  steps:
    - id: resolve
      action: add the module to go.mod through the Go tool
      note: api:cli-package does this and writes the declaration in one step; both are ordinary edits an author can make without it
    - id: read-manifest
      action: api:cli-generate reads data:component-package-manifest from the module cache
      failure: a declared module with no package section is an error naming the module, because the declaration claimed a capability the module does not publish
    - id: check
      action: verify policy:package-compatibility versions, the requirement:database-engine-selection engine, and every requires.capabilities member
      failure: name the missing capability and stop; nothing has been written
    - id: link
      action: emit the blank import for each declared package into the generated bootstrap of the project.main package
      effect: this links a package the application never names in Go, so the declaration alone installs it
      redundant_when: the package serves routes and the application already imports it for the next step
    - id: mount
      actor: actor:application-developer
      action: call the package's Register on the mux, only for a package that serves routes
      shape: identical to the api:page-registry call a project already makes for its own concept:page-tree
      why_manual: decision:declared-package-installation rejected an installed route contributor, because mounting is the one contribution an application has an opinion about
    - id: generate
      action: the rest of api:cli-generate over the project's own sources, unchanged
      note: no dependency is read as a generation source at any point
    - id: migrate
      action: api:cli-migrate applies each declared package's requirement:package-schema-contribution stream, then the application's
      review: pending package statements are printed before they are applied
  runtime:
    - api:package-registration runs from each linked package's init
    - requirement:package-asset-delivery mounts the embedded assets
    - an api:framework-extension the package registered installs at its slot
    - the package's generated configuration binding registers its defaults, which an environment file may override and need not mention
  failure:
    stale_artifact: a package published with a stale generated file fails at go build, naming the package
    route_collision: an ordinary mux registration conflict, because the application performed both registrations
upgrade:
  action: go get -u, then api:cli-generate and api:cli-migrate
  copied_nothing: so there is no second install step to forget, per decision:declared-package-installation
removal:
  action: delete the declaration and any Register call, then api:cli-generate
  effect: the blank import disappears and the package stops linking; its tables stay and api:cli-doctor reports them as unowned
related:
  - flow:capability-addition, which is the wizard against the built-in catalog and still writes files, per rule:framework-owned-tables
  - requirement:component-package-distribution
```
