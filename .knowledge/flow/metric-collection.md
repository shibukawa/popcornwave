title: Metric Collection Flow
---
Metric export is interval-driven rather than record-driven: a reader wakes, collects every instrument and observable of data:framework-metric-set into one aggregation, and posts it once, which is why it shares the exporter of flow:telemetry-export and none of its queue.

```yaml
flow:
  trigger: the reader interval elapses, or shutdown begins
  steps:
    - id: collect_synchronous
      action: read the accumulated aggregation of every counter, up_down_counter, and histogram recorded on a request or statement path
      note: recording is an add into an existing attribute set, so the request path never touches this step
    - id: collect_observable
      action: invoke each registered callback once — one per pwruntime Connection for the pool group, one per data:cache-store-set store, one for the go runtime group
      bound: a callback that blocks blocks the interval, so each reads an already-computed value and performs no query
      failure: a callback that fails omits its series for that interval and reports once, rather than failing the export
    - id: aggregate
      action: resolve one data point per instrument per attribute set, with the configured temporality
    - id: encode
      action: encode the OTLP metric message with the same JSON Protobuf mapping requirement:contrib-otel already uses for spans and records
    - id: send
      action: POST to /v1/metrics, derived from the base endpoint the way the traces and logs paths already are
    - id: retry
      action: the bounded exponential backoff of flow:telemetry-export, on the same client and the same timeout
      exhausted: the interval is lost; see loss below
  shutdown:
    - stop the interval
    - collect and export once more within the context deadline, so the counts of the final interval are not the ones discarded
    - return the exporter error, with no stdout fallback, per data:observability-runtime-config
why_not_the_batch_queue:
  fact: flow:telemetry-export queues one record per span and per log entry and drops on a full queue
  contrast: a metric has no records; the aggregation is bounded by the attribute-set count and does not grow with traffic, so there is nothing to bound and nothing to drop
  consequence: the queue_size and max_export_size of data:observability-runtime-config do not apply here, and the reader interval is a separate key from flush_interval because one is how often a batch leaves and the other is how coarse every chart becomes
  shared: the endpoint, the headers, the client, the timeout, and the retry policy, since it is one exporter with a third path
loss:
  delta:
    behavior: each export carries what happened since the previous one, so a failed export loses those counts permanently
    suits: requirement:dev-telemetry-viewer, whose pane charts a session and differences nothing, and an instance short enough that a cumulative total never becomes meaningful
  cumulative:
    behavior: each export carries the total since process start, so a failed export is repaired by the next one
    suits: a long-lived deployment, at the cost of a reader that has to know when the series restarted
  therefore: temporality is the open key of requirement:framework-metrics rather than a constant, and this is the fact that decides it
  visible_downstream: system:localotelviewer reads the temporality of each point and charts a cumulative histogram from the latest point alone, so both choices already display correctly
cost:
  disabled: no reader goroutine, no ticker, and no registered callback
  enabled_idle: one wake per interval producing one export of whatever the instruments hold, including nothing
timing:
  interval: an observability.metrics key, defaulting near the flush_interval of the trace path so a dev loop shows both signals on one rhythm
  alignment: not aligned to a wall clock, because two instances aligned to one boundary export together and a backend sees the sum arrive in bursts
open:
  no_background_interval:
    where: requirement:cloudflare-workers-hosting, where nothing runs between requests
    consequence: a reader with no time of its own has to collect and export on the request path, which is a different flow rather than a tuning of this one
    deferred: that target emits no supported artifact today, so this is recorded and not designed
```
