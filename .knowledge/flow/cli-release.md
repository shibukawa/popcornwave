title: CLI Release Flow
---
A pushed version tag is the only trigger that turns repository source into data:release-artifact and updates every install channel.

```yaml
trigger: push of a tag matching v* on the default branch history
preconditions:
  - the working tree at the tag builds and passes go test
  - go.mod, go.sum, and the recorded flake vendorHash agree
  - the release preparation commit has set the decision:nix-flake-packaging version string to the tag
  - the previous tag is already released or explicitly abandoned
steps:
  - checkout the tag with full history
  - resolve the version string from the tag by dropping the leading v
  - run go test ./... once on the native target
  - build every requirement:cli-distribution target with the data:release-artifact flags
  - smoke test the native archive by extracting it and running pw version and pw help
  - assemble archives and checksums.txt
  - create the GitHub release for the tag and upload every archive and the checksum file
  - bump the decision:homebrew-tap-channel formula from the published urls and checksums
  - report the release url and the tap commit
manual_follow_up:
  - update flake.lock only when a nixpkgs change is intended; a release itself does not move it
  - announce the tag in the documentation site when the release changes documented behavior
failure:
  - a test or build failure stops before the release is created and publishes nothing
  - a smoke test failure stops before the release is created
  - an upload failure leaves the release as a draft for manual repair, never a partial published set
  - a tap bump failure leaves the release intact, reports nonzero, and is repaired by rerunning the tap job
prerelease:
  behavior: publish as a GitHub prerelease
  skipped: the tap bump
  reason: brew users must not receive a prerelease implicitly
rollback:
  - a broken release is superseded by a new patch tag, never by deleting or replacing artifacts
  - a broken formula is reverted in the tap independently of the release
```
