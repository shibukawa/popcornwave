TinyBind is the generated binding, configuration, response, validation, streaming, and OpenAPI engine wrapped by the Popcorn Wave public APIs.

```yaml
module: github.com/shibukawa/tinybind-go
html_template_baseline: v0.1.15
html_async_baseline: v0.1.20
public_wrappers:
  - api:request-binding
  - api:html-response
  - api:api-response
  - api:typed-stream
  - api:problem-response
  - api:runtime-configuration
generator:
  extensible_analysis: requirement:httpbinder-extensible-route-analysis
  openapi:
    - package fragments register during import
    - AssembleOpenAPI returns one deterministic merged JSON document; YAML output was dropped
  configuration:
    - generated definitions register during import
    - ScaffoldTOML and ScaffoldEnv merge every package definition
  html:
    - .pw.html components generate immutable htmlbind.Fragment values
    - components with an unnamed slot also generate htmlbind.Wrapper binders
    - api:render-html-chain composes wrappers around a leaf
    - "`external async` declarations bind Go functions returning a value and an error"
    - "`async T` parameters and record fields become htmlbind.Pending[T], surfaced by api:async-html-value"
    - await, fallback, and recover clauses compile to boundaries described by api:html-boundary-protocol
    - the generated plan carries a constant HasAwaitBlock flag used by decision:automatic-async-render-selection
    - the async render path emits placeholders and bare fragments; completion framing and the client runtime belong to the framework
  sql:
    - decision:tinybind-sql-runtime owns statement plans and shared execution
    - declared sql.exec, sql.one, sql.optional, or sql.many selects Exec or Query
    - incompatible SQL result contracts fail generation
    - a SQL dialect option selects the target engine, required from v0.2.2 with no default
    - the dialect carries the placeholder style, dollar for postgresql and question for mysql and sqlite
    - postgresql, mysql, and sqlite from v0.2.3, which covers every decision:server-sql-support-tier first-class engine
constraints:
  - generator executes with host Go
  - generated mapping path avoids runtime field reflection
  - route discovery analyzes same-package registrations recognized by versioned adapters
  - normal handwritten application code does not import TinyBind
compatibility:
  sql_v0_2_2: the SQL dialect became a required generation input, so a run that discovers a .pw.sql without one is a configuration error rather than a silent postgresql assumption
  sql_v0_2_3: the sqlite dialect is additive and emits the question placeholders sqlite already generated through mysql, so naming it changes no generated output
  html_v0_1_15: generated HTML APIs are not source-compatible with earlier direct-writer output
  html_v0_1_19: async parameters and async render entry points are additive, so existing templates and call sites keep compiling after regeneration
  html_v0_1_20: Content.WriteTo narrows to the bare fragment and the module injects no client runtime, so an async caller must supply framing and a runtime it previously inherited
```
