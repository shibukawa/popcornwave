title: tinygodriver Firestore Datastore Client
---
The TinyGo-buildable client for Firestore in Datastore mode that Popcorn Wave configures and hands to system:tinybind firestorebind; it speaks the Datastore v1 JSON API directly.

```yaml
package: github.com/shibukawa/tinygodriver/nosql/datastore
part_of: system:tinygodriver
minimum_version: v1.1.9
version_history:
  v1.1.3: the version this repository currently requires; carries nosql/dynamodb only and no datastore at all
  v1.1.4: introduced nosql/datastore
  v1.1.5: exported the service limits, added the Index descriptors and the struct mapper
  v1.1.6: added OR composition, SUM and AVG, mutation sizing, and attached the partition to every key on the wire rather than only the top one
  v1.1.8: started a transaction lazily inside the first call that needs one, published the commit envelope size, stated the read-time bound, and stopped the README contradicting the code
  v1.1.9: the version this repository requires
  why_v1_1_6_was_the_floor: the partition fix is a correctness fix for a key stored as a property, and the earlier tags carry it broken
  why_the_floor_moved_to_v1_1_8: the lazy transaction removes a round trip from every conditional write of decision:firestore-conditional-writes, which is a cost this backend pays per ceremony rather than a convenience
  why_v1_1_9_now: system:tinybind firestorebind requires it, so the two move together rather than this repository naming the higher one
upstream_catalog: the tinygodriver repository ships its own concepts for the client, the value codec, the retry policy, the write preconditions, and the emulator endpoint; read them there rather than restating them
recorded_here: only the facts a Popcorn Wave concept depends on
naming:
  driver_package: datastore, after the API it speaks
  binding: firestorebind, after the product
  popcornwave_side: firestore everywhere, per decision:firestore-datastore-mode-only
constructor: New(projectID string, opts ...Option) (*Client, error)
credentials:
  package: github.com/shibukawa/tinygodriver/cloud/google
  default: CredentialsFromEnv, which reads GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and nothing else
  no_adc_chain: the well-known gcloud config path, external account files, workload identity federation, and impersonation are all absent
  token_sources: [JWTTokenSource, OAuth2TokenSource, MetadataTokenSource, StaticTokenSource]
  default_source: a self-signed JWT, so no token-endpoint round trip happens before the first call
  audience: the service host with a trailing slash, per source; a token minted for one API is refused by another
  caching: google.Cached refreshes 60s before expiry on the calling goroutine; there is no background refresher
  metadata_source: the only path that links no RSA code, and the one a Cloud Run or GKE deployment wants
  consequence_for_pw: data:firestore-runtime-config has to name the source, because the driver's own default resolution covers one of the four
  rs256_only: ES256 is not implemented, so a workload-identity flow needing it has no path here
clock_skew:
  fact: a self-signed JWT is only valid against the server's clock, and a wrong clock mints a token reported as UNAUTHENTICATED
  not_retryable: UNAUTHENTICATED is refreshed once and resent, and a clock hours out survives that
  effect_here: api:firestore-package startup diagnostics name the clock as the likely cause of that status, because the status itself does not
no_table_admin:
  fact: kinds are implicit and come into being on first write; there is no CreateTable, DescribeTable, or ListTables counterpart
  consequences:
    - requirement:dynamodb-migration has no counterpart, per decision:firestore-no-schema-application
    - the readiness and startup checks of api:firestore-package cannot be a table listing, because there is no listing
    - rule:framework-owned-tables verification has nothing to observe, so it is replaced rather than reached by another route
partial_update:
  fact: absent; an update replaces the whole entity
  effect_here: the Touch of requirement:firestore-session-store rewrites the record rather than patching two timestamps, and pays a read to have the payload to rewrite
conditional_writes: decision:firestore-conditional-writes
transactions:
  present: RunInTransaction and RunReadOnly, with the ABORTED closure re-run inside them
  round_trips: beginTransaction, then the reads, then commit; three at minimum
  lazy_start:
    landed: v1.1.8, after this repository asked for the fold
    what: no beginTransaction of its own; the transaction starts inside whichever call needs it first, through readOptions.newTransaction on a read or singleUseTransaction on the commit
    cost_now: one read plus one commit is two round trips; N reads are N+1; a write-only closure is one; a closure that neither reads nor writes is none, because no handle was ever taken
    wider_than_asked: the ask was the one-read-one-commit fold, and the answer covers every closure shape
    rollback: skipped when no call ever started one, since there is no handle to release
  closure_re_runs: ABORTED restarts the whole closure, so a closure with a side effect outside the transaction performs it more than once; this is what keeps the activation callback of decision:firestore-conditional-writes outside one
  no_rollback_needed_on_the_error_path: mutations are queued and sent with the commit, so a closure returning an error writes nothing
property_transformations:
  absent: server-side increment and array-append are excluded by the driver deliberately, as the non-idempotent-retry hazard
  effect_here: the attempt spend of requirement:firestore-auth-stores cannot be one atomic decrement and is a transaction instead
consistency:
  default: strong, for reads and for queries
  option: WithEventualConsistency, per read
  effect_here: decision:dynamodb-session-read-consistency has no counterpart; there is no false-miss window to retry around and no consistent_read key to configure
queries:
  builder: NewQuery(kind).Filter.Where.Ancestor.Order.OrderDesc.Project.KeysOnly.DistinctOn.Limit.Offset.Start.End
  single_property_indexes: automatic, so a filter on any property needs no declaration; this is what replaces the global secondary index of requirement:dynamodb-auth-stores
  composite_indexes: required for an equality filter combined with an inequality or an order on another property, declared out of band and failing at run time with FAILED_PRECONDITION when absent
  descriptors: Index, IndexProperty, and MarshalIndexYAML describe one; applying it is an admin-API operation and out of scope
  no_required_index_derivation: the driver declines to work out which index a query needs, holding that a quietly wrong derivation names an index that does not fix the query
  paging: one batch per call, EndCursor feeds Start, nothing loops for the caller
  or_and_aggregation: OR through a condition tree, and Count, Sum and Avg over runAggregationQuery, all present at v1.1.6
errors:
  wrapper: "*datastore.Error with Op, Kind, StatusCode, Status, Message, Unwrap, Retryable"
  discrimination: the Status string, never the HTTP code, because ABORTED and ALREADY_EXISTS are both 409 and mean opposite things
  sentinels_used_by_pw: [ErrNoSuchEntity, ErrAlreadyExists, ErrAborted, ErrFailedPrecondition, ErrUnauthenticated, ErrPermissionDenied, ErrUnavailable, ErrTooManyKeys]
  passthrough: the firestorebind layer of system:tinybind wraps with %w or not at all, so a Popcorn Wave caller matches these directly
lookup_results:
  shape: Found, Missing and Deferred are three lists
  deferred: keys the server did not read, handed back rather than retried inside the call
  effect_here: an incomplete allowlist answer is an error rather than a non-match, exactly as requirement:dynamodb-auth-stores decided for an unprocessed batch key
limits:
  exported: as constants, so no Popcorn Wave concept copies a number out of Google's documentation
  MaxLookupKeys: 1000, checked by GetMulti, which answers ErrTooManyKeys
  MaxRequestBytes: 10 MiB
  MaxTransactionBytes: 10 MiB
  MaxEntityBytes: 1 MiB minus 4
  MaxKeyBytes: 6 KiB
  MaxIndexedStringBytes: 1500, above which a string is stored and simply not indexed
  MaxNestingDepth: 20
  no_mutation_count: Google documents none, so a batch write chunks by size; Client.MutationSize gives the encoded size with the partition attached
  indexed_string_hazard: a long indexed string is silently unindexed rather than refused, which is why requirement:firestore-session-store marks every blob and digest Unindexed rather than relying on a bound
retry:
  request: 3 attempts, 25 ms base, 1 s cap, full jitter, over UNAVAILABLE, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED and RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED
  internal: retried exactly once, per Google's own guidance
  unauthenticated: the token is refreshed once and the request resent, outside the retry budget
  aborted: inside a transaction the closure re-runs; outside one it is terminal, because there is nothing to re-run
  delivery_bound: attempts x 2, because the native transport replays once on a connection the peer had closed
  no_response_integrity: there is no x-amz-crc32 counterpart, so TLS is the only guarantee on this path; a real difference from system:tinygodriver-dynamodb rather than an oversight
ttl:
  answer: not expressible on this wire
  what_it_is_instead: a field-level policy over an ordinary timestamp property, applied with gcloud firestore fields ttls update
  bounds: one TTL property per kind, at most 500 policies per database, deletion within about 24 hours of expiry
  datastore_mode_extra: TTL cannot be combined with a concurrency mode of Optimistic With Entity Groups
  effect_here: decision:firestore-expiry-policy, and no upstream ask, because there is nothing for the driver to call
transport:
  http_client: WithHTTPClient replaces the whole client, which is the same seam decision:dynamodb-observability-seam uses
  close: required, because pooled native TLS handles outlive the last request; skipped for a client built with WithHTTPClient
  pool: 4 idle connections by default, raised with WithMaxIdleConns; one host per client
emulator:
  server: gcloud beta emulators datastore start, a Java process inside the google/cloud-sdk image
  discovery: DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST, read by the client when no endpoint is given
  no_scheme: a value with no scheme is taken as http
  auth_is_absent: when the emulator variable is set and no endpoint is given the client sends no Authorization header at all, because the emulator ignores it
  sharper_gap_than_dynamodb: DynamoDB Local at least requires a well-formed signature, so the credential path here has no offline coverage whatever
  weight: heavier than amazon/dynamodb-local, which api:cli-dev has to account for
  wrong_emulator: the Firestore emulator serves native mode and is a different API; Datastore mode needs the Datastore emulator specifically
excluded_by_the_driver: [GQL, ReserveIds, the admin API, watch and listeners, property transformations, auto-pagination, explain options]
sizing:
  MutationSize: one mutation as it will be sent, with the partition attached
  CommitOverheadBytes: what a commit of n mutations spends on top of them, so the two together account for the whole body
  landed: v1.1.8, consumed by firestorebind from v0.3.7, and it is measured from the real request struct rather than returned as a constant, so a field added to the wire shape is counted without anyone remembering to update a number
  effect_here: nothing this repository writes chunks a batch today; it is recorded because requirement:firestore-test-isolation deletes in bulk and would otherwise invent a figure
upstream_requests:
  state: none open; the change request document that carried them is deleted, and what each became is recorded here
  asked_and_answered:
    round_2026_08_03: index descriptors, exported service limits, OR composition, SUM and AVG, the uint wrap, mutation sizing, and unpartitioned key properties, all in v1.1.6
    round_2026_08_05_driver: the single-use transaction, which landed as the lazy start above and covers more closure shapes than were asked for; the README contradicting itself over SUM and AVG; and the WithReadTime bound, stated as two windows with the local range check declined because the client cannot know whether point-in-time recovery is enabled
    round_2026_08_05_binding: RemoveKeys, MutationSize over a local constant, KeyFor and KeysFor, and the declaration-only ttl tag, all in v0.3.6
    commit_envelope: firestorebind held a guessed figure while the driver published CommitOverheadBytes; closed in v0.3.7, which chunks with the driver's own over v1.1.9
  withdrawn:
    write_discovery: reported as a gap where a firestorebind write did not direct the codec
    actual_cause: a test fixture on this side whose imports did not resolve, so no call site was discoverable at all
    what_upstream_did: v0.3.7 reports that condition and names the fix rather than generating half a codec, which is what turned the wrong conclusion into a one-line fixture repair
    lesson: a usage-directed generator reading an unresolvable package looks exactly like one that ignores calls, so a fixture that cannot build is not evidence about discovery
not_wanted_here:
  admin_api: index and TTL application, per decision:firestore-no-schema-application and decision:firestore-expiry-policy; the framework would not call either if it had them
  required_index_derivation: the driver declined it for a reason this repository agrees with
```
