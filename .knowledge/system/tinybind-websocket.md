title: TinyBind Typed WebSocket
---
system:tinybind v0.5.7 ships a typed WebSocket on both of its transports, with the codecs generated from the two type arguments, which is the whole engine requirement:typed-websocket wraps.

```yaml
read_2026_08_11: from the module source and its own catalog, not inferred
baseline: tinybind-go v0.5.7, over system:tinygodriver v1.2.3 or later, which is where its three websocket packages first exist together
entries:
  net_http: "httpbind.WebSocket[In, Out](w, r, fn) error and WebSocketWith taking SocketOptions"
  fasthttp: "fasthttpbind.WebSocket[In, Out](ctx, fn) error and WebSocketWith"
  callback: "func(*Socket[In, Out]) error, the same shape WriteStream takes and for the same reason"
  return_value: the handshake error alone; a non-nil value means the refusal response is already written
  callback_error: post-commit on both transports, routed to the handler installed with SetStreamErrorHandler, which is the sink the stream already uses
socket_type:
  declared: internal/bindcore, aliased by both surfaces, so pw.Socket and pwfast.Socket would be one type exactly as pw.Stream and pwfast.Stream are
  read: "Read() (In, error), decoding one text frame through jsonbind.DecodeJSONBytes; single reader, unguarded by design"
  write: "Write(Out) error, encoding straight into the frame writer under a mutex the control frames share, so any goroutine may call it"
  close: normal-closure handshake, idempotent, run by the runtime whatever the callback returns
  subprotocol: readable from the socket, so the callback never reaches the driver Conn for it
  binary_frame: returned as an error rather than decoded, since the socket carries JSON
codec_generation:
  what: "two call patterns against one target — index 0 decoded, index 1 encoded"
  api: "generator.SocketReceiveCall and generator.SocketSendCall, registered for WebSocket and WebSocketWith"
  inference: both types are recovered from the closure parameter, so a call site spells no type argument
  feature_flag: FeatureWebSocket, gated together with FeatureDecodeJSON and FeatureEncodeJSON per direction
  one_codec_each_direction: an inbound type gets a decoder and no encoder, so a socket adds no dead code to a TinyGo binary
  registry_exception: the module permits the two socket operations on one target, where two patterns on one target are otherwise a conflict
lifecycle_the_module_owns:
  read_limit: 1 MiB default, separate from the JSON body bound
  idle_timeout: 60s, set before every read, with no spelling for disabling it
  ping_interval: 54s, refused when it is not below the idle bound
  write_timeout: 10s
  pong_handler: installed by the runtime to push the read deadline forward, without which a peer answering every ping still expires
  reason_it_cannot_be_optional: netdev takes a read deadline by value at call time, so an unbounded read is a goroutine and a connection nothing can interrupt
  defaults: process-wide through SetSocketDefaults, per-call through the With form; a zero field never reaches the driver
origin_seam:
  shape: "func(origin, host string) bool in the transport-free options, so one policy serves both transports"
  module_default: refuse when Origin is present and names another host, admit when it is absent
  refusal: 403 with code websocket_origin, written through the driver's Error hook as RFC 9457 Problem Details
  why_it_is_a_seam: the two upgraders' own hooks name their own request type, which is what the two strings exist to avoid
  this_framework_replaces_it: decision:websocket-origin-check-owner
what_the_module_does_not_own:
  - the read loop, which is the callback's
  - the protocol and its discriminator field, which is the application's
  - any registry of live connections; no hub, no rooms, no broadcast
  - reconnection and delivery guarantees
  - an OpenAPI or AsyncAPI artifact for a socket route
tinygo_serving:
  constraint: TinyGo's net/http cannot complete an upgrade; it starts a background read before the handler and cancels it by moving a deadline into the past, which netdev cannot do to a recv already in flight
  symptom: the handshake hangs with no error, no panic and no log line
  fix: serve through the tinygodriver httpserver package, which reads the request head itself and hands an upgrade a hijackable writer
  under_host_go: that entry calls srv.Serve and nothing else
  module_stance: documented rather than re-exported, because the import edge would land in every net/http build
  this_framework_differs: decision:websocket-upgrade-capable-server
  guard_that_ships: the net/http entry asserts http.Hijacker and refuses with a 500 websocket_hijack rather than hanging
  fasthttp_unaffected: RequestCtx.Hijack is a synchronous handoff with no background read
```
