title: Preference Hint Runtime Config
---
The `html` binding gates preference reading, declares which client hints are requested, and decides whether a cold navigation pays a retry for them.

```yaml
prefix: html
registration: extends the binding of data:html-render-config rather than adding a second one, because these tune the same render
keys:
  html.preference_hints: bool gating requirement:user-preference-rendering as a whole
  html.preference_cookie: name of the override cookie read by api:user-preference-accessors
  html.preference_accept_ch: string list of hint headers declared through Accept-CH
  html.preference_critical_ch: string list of hint headers additionally declared through Critical-CH
defaults:
  html.preference_hints: "false"
  html.preference_cookie: pw_pref
  html.preference_accept_ch: empty
  html.preference_critical_ch: empty
why_off_by_default:
  fact: an application with correct CSS already renders correctly, per decision:preference-signal-precedence
  consequence: enabling this buys a server-chosen attribute and costs a Vary, so it is a choice an operator makes rather than one a scaffold makes
  scaffold: api:cli-init writes no value, so a new project has nothing to turn off
emission:
  where: api:html-response, on the document path only, beside the Vary of policy:preference-vary-correctness
  accept_ch: emitted when preference_accept_ch is non-empty, teaching the client which hints to send on later requests to this origin
  critical_ch: emitted only for headers also present in preference_accept_ch, so the pairing the client requires cannot be misconfigured
  fragment: api:html-fragment-response emits neither, since decision:buffered-fragment-delivery answers a request whose document already declared them
  not_a_head_tag: these are response headers; the head channel of decision:runtime-tag-injection carries nothing for this requirement
critical_ch_costs_a_round_trip:
  mechanism: a client that receives Critical-CH and did not send the listed hints discards the response and retries once with them attached, before rendering
  bound: at most one retry per request, so it cannot loop
  who_pays: the cold navigation to an origin, which decision:preference-signal-precedence records as the visit worth the most
  separate_key_because: an operator who wants Accept-CH for later pages should not be forced to buy the retry for the first one
  reach: Chromium only, and not on the standards track, so the retry must never be what makes an application correct
rules:
  - preference_hints false skips cookie and header parsing entirely, so every accessor reports absent and no Accept-CH is emitted
  - a header in preference_critical_ch and absent from preference_accept_ch is a startup error, not a silently dropped value
  - Sec-CH-Viewport-Width may be declared, and never reaches Vary, per policy:preference-vary-correctness
  - an unrecognized header name is a startup error, so a typo does not become a hint that never arrives
  - an empty preference_cookie disables override reading and leaves hint resolution intact
  - reject a cookie name that is not a valid token at startup
  - values are read per response from the request context, like every other key of data:html-render-config
sources: config.toml, environment variable, and CLI flag, under decision:independent-runtime-config-bindings
unparsed_default: registration seeds the target with the documented values, for the reason data:html-render-config gives
consumers:
  - api:html-response
  - api:user-preference-accessors
  - policy:preference-vary-correctness
```
