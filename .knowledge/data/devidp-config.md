title: Development IdP Configuration
---
A single TOML file declares the requirement:contrib-devidp issuer, clients, and user roster, including the extra claims each selected user receives.

```yaml
file: devidp.toml
default_location: project root, overridden by data:project-config dev.idp.config
schema:
  idp:
    issuer: optional absolute URL; the host assigns a loopback issuer on a reserved port when omitted
    valid_scopes: additional scope tokens beyond openid, profile, and email
    token_ttl: access and ID Token lifetime, default 1h
    code_ttl: authorization code lifetime, default 1m
    signing_key: optional PEM path; an ephemeral RSA key is generated when omitted
  clients:
    presence: optional; api:cli-dev and api:testutil-idp register their own ephemeral client instead
    "<client_id>":
      secret: required non-empty string
      redirect_uris: required non-empty list of exact absolute URLs
      valid_scopes: optional per-client scope restriction
  users:
    "<key>":
      subject: optional stable sub, defaulting to the table key
      display_name: label shown by ui:devidp-login
      extra_scopes: scope tokens this user may be granted
      claims: table of extra ID Token and UserInfo claims
claim_values:
  allowed: string, integer, boolean, and arrays of those types
  reserved: iss, sub, aud, exp, iat, nbf, auth_time, nonce, azp, and at_hash cannot be set through claims
rules:
  - unknown keys and unknown tables are errors, matching data:project-config
  - a table header with no fields still declares its user, because a silently dropped roster entry is worse than a strict parse
  - the file is development tooling input and never a runtime configbind source
  - relative paths resolve from the config file directory
  - duplicate subjects across roster entries are errors
  - a declared client with an empty secret or an empty redirect_uris list is an error
  - a file with no clients table is valid, because the running tool supplies the client
  - the file declares identities and scopes only; issuer, port, and client wiring belong to the tool that starts the provider
  - a scope requested by a client but absent from idp.valid_scopes and the user extra_scopes is dropped, not an error
  - a missing file is an error except when the caller supplies an in-memory roster
  - secrets in this file are development fixtures and must not be reused by any deployed environment
loaders:
  - api:cli-dev reads the path from data:project-config dev.idp.config and the port from dev.idp.port
  - api:testutil-idp accepts a path or an in-memory roster and overrides the issuer with a reserved loopback port
```
