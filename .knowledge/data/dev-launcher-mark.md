title: Development Launcher Mark
---
The single popcorn kernel requirement:dev-console-launcher wears, cut from the documentation site logo so the control the developer clicks is the same character the project introduces itself with.

```yaml
source:
  file: website/src/assets/logo.png, the documentation site logo
  subject: the foremost kernel, lower left of the illustration, front facing with both eyes and an open smile
  why_one_kernel: the whole illustration is a wide spilled box, and a wide illustration reduced to a 28px square reads as a smear. One kernel is a face, and a face is what stays recognisable at that size
  why_that_kernel: it is the largest, the only one facing the viewer squarely, and the only one whose eyes both carry highlights; every other kernel is turned, partly occluded, or drawn at a size that was never meant to survive reduction
extraction:
  crop: 396x396 at +20+448 of the 1448x1086 source
  isolate: threshold at 62% grey so the kernel's dark outline is the only closed figure, flood fill inward from all four corners to mark background, keep components above 5000px so the loose kernels drop out, and take the result as the alpha channel
  edge: closed over a two pixel disk and blurred by half a pixel, because a hard threshold leaves the painted outline aliased against nothing
  why_not_a_rectangle: the kernel overlaps a motion trail and several loose kernels that a rectangular crop cannot exclude and that read as dirt once the mark is small
  trim: to content, then padded to a square so the mark is centred without the consumer measuring anything
  result: 352x352 with an alpha channel and no background
  reproducible: the recipe is recorded so a redrawn logo can be re-cut rather than re-traced by eye
format:
  chosen: raster, served at 96px, which covers three times the largest size the control displays it at
  why_not_svg: the illustration is painted — gradient shading, a varying outline weight, and specular highlights — and a hand-drawn vector of it would be a different drawing wearing the same shape, which costs the recognition the mark exists for
  encoding: WebP, 3782 bytes against 15445 for the equivalent PNG; the mark is served only to a developer running api:cli-dev, so there is no browser worth carrying the larger file for
  committed: the encoded bytes, not the encoder; nothing in the build reads an image library, and data:release-artifact stays the pure-Go cross-compile it was
delivery:
  as: its own entry in the pwdev script set, served from the framework prefix under the same revision segment as the module that references it
  why_not_a_data_uri: an inlined image is subject to the application's own img-src, so a project that tightened its policy to default-src 'self' would lose the mark; served from the application's origin it is covered by 'self' like every other framework asset
  consequence: the asset set is no longer only JavaScript, so the framework asset handler picks a content type by extension rather than sending one for everything
  revision: the bytes join the digest that already spans the set, so the mark cannot be served stale under a URL cached as immutable
rules:
  - embedded under the pwdev build constraint only, so api:cli-build has no bytes to ship and no name to serve them under
  - the mark is decoration and carries no state; it never varies by request, by application, or by project
  - it is not the project's logo and no application is asked to adopt it; requirement:dev-console-launcher is its only consumer
consumers:
  - requirement:dev-console-launcher
