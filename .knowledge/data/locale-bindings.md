title: Locale Implicit Bindings
---
Three implicit bindings are registered with system:tinybind, and the split among them is what decides where each may be written and what a cached component keys on.

```yaml
registration: the implicit binding list of the template generation options, per decision:upstream-message-surface item E
entries:
  message_locale:
    kind: ordinary, with a typed provider returning pw.Locale
    role: the leading argument of every generated message symbol, named as the message context binding
    written_into_markup: never; upstream carries no escaping rule for a type it has not seen, and refuses it in a value position
    why_it_exists_as_a_binding: it makes a reference an ordinary reader of a binding, so the cache-key walk finds it with no rule about messages anywhere
  lang:
    kind: path segment
    provider_result: string
    value: the locale tag under decision:locale-url-modes path mode, empty under cookie and header mode, and empty for the default locale when prefix_default is false
    written_into: url attributes, where an empty value collapses one preceding separator
  langtag:
    kind: ordinary
    provider_result: string
    value: the resolved locale tag, never empty, in every mode
    written_into: anywhere, being the document language attribute and the asset paths of requirement:localized-assets
why_three_rather_than_two:
  earlier_reading: two, a tag and a path segment, per decision:explicit-locale-in-links
  what_added_the_third: the typed provider, which lets the message path carry pw.Locale rather than a tag string, so a generated symbol takes the catalog's own type
  consequence: the value a message resolves against and the value written into a URL are different bindings of different types, and neither can stand in for the other
vary_axis:
  declared: per binding, named by this project rather than by upstream
  folded_into: the response vary, through the path a builtin element already uses
  by_mode:
    path: empty axis on every binding, which is what an application carrying the value in its URL declares
    cookie: the locale cookie and Accept-Language
    header: Accept-Language
  why_the_axis_lives_here: policy:locale-vary-correctness states what each mode must emit, and this is the mechanism that emits it
cache_identity:
  rule: a cached component keys on the bindings its call graph reaches, not on every declared one
  effect: a component rendering no message and writing no locale into markup keys exactly as it did before these bindings existed
  interaction: policy:layered-cache gains the binding values in the key, which is what makes a cached component safe to reuse across readers of one locale and not across two
  supersedes: the earlier constraint that a locale-varying component must take the locale as a declared parameter or not be cached
redraw_path:
  rule: a binding is an input the browser must not supply, so the component redraw endpoint derives it from the request rather than accepting it
  why: the redraw contract otherwise passes every input, and a client-supplied locale would let a reader choose which cached representation they are served
  where_it_is_checked: rule:locale-prefix-checks
shadowing: a template parameter taking any of these names fails generation at the parameter, naming the binding and where it was declared
unused_is_free: a project declaring these bindings and reading none generates byte-identical Go
```
