title: Query Diagnostics Config
---
The `observability.query` sub-binding configures requirement:query-diagnostics as part of data:observability-runtime-config rather than as database pool configuration.

```yaml
placement:
  binding: observability
  rationale: the feature produces log records, so it follows the logger lifecycle; data:middleware-runtime-config rdb fields stay pool-only
fields:
  enabled: auto, on, or off
  level: severity for a normal record
  slow_threshold: duration; zero disables slow detection, EXPLAIN, and reproduction
  slow_level: severity for a record marked slow
  bind_values: auto, on, or off
  explain: bool
  reproduction: bool
  max_sql_length: positive integer
  max_value_length: positive integer
defaults:
  enabled: auto
  level: info
  slow_threshold: 200ms
  slow_level: warn
  bind_values: auto
  explain: true
  reproduction: true
  max_sql_length: 4096
  max_value_length: 256
level_default:
  value: info rather than debug
  reason: api:logger is still backed by the standard library logger and nothing builds a handler from minimum_level, so a debug record would be dropped; a development aid that is on by default has to be visible by default
auto:
  dev: enabled and bind_values resolve to on when data:runtime-environment is dev
  other: both resolve to off
rules:
  - registration is automatic in pw, like the rest of data:observability-runtime-config
  - an explicit on outside dev is honored and surfaced through policy:query-log-safety
  - explain and reproduction have no effect while enabled resolves to off or slow_threshold is zero
  - reproduction has no effect while bind_values resolves to off, per rule:query-reproduction-format
  - level and slow_level are still filtered by the process logger, per policy:log-emission
  - a zero bound means unset and takes its default, so a partial configuration is still bounded
  - reject an unknown enum value, a negative bound, a negative duration, and an unknown key at startup
  - an invalid value disables diagnostics rather than half-enabling them; validation reports it before requests are served
```
