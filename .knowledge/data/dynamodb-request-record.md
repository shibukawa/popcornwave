title: DynamoDB Request Record
---
One DynamoDB request produces one diagnostic record, shaped like data:query-record so one viewer reads both stores, and carrying what only the wire can report.

```yaml
message: dynamo request
seam: decision:dynamodb-observability-seam, so the record is built from the HTTP exchange rather than from a call site
always:
  operation: the DynamoDB operation, read from the request target header
  table: the deployed table name, as sent
  duration: observed wall time of the exchange
  outcome: ok or error
conditional:
  declared_table: the name before rule:dynamodb-table-naming resolved it, present when the two differ
  statement: the requirement:dynamodb-typed-queries declaration name, present when a generated function issued the request
  request_id: the service request identifier, which is what an AWS support case needs
  consumed_capacity: present only when the request asked for it, since the service does not volunteer it
  scanned_count: present on a query or scan, and the number that makes a filter-heavy read visible
  item_count: items returned by a query or scan
  has_more: true when the reply carried a last evaluated key
  retries: attempts the driver made, which no call site can otherwise see
  error: safe message and the driver sentinel it maps to
  slow: true when duration reaches the configured threshold
  body: the request payload, present only while bind values are on, per policy:query-log-safety
  reproduction: snippet built by rule:dynamodb-reproduction-format
  truncated: true when the body hit its bound
absent_by_design:
  - anything for a rule:framework-owned-tables table, which produces no record at all
  - the endpoint, the region, and every credential
  - the reply body, since a record is about the request and its outcome, not its results
why_the_extra_fields:
  retries: the driver retries internally and documents that a write can be delivered twice, so a caller that sees one call may have caused two
  scanned_count: the only signal separating a query that reads what it returns from one that reads a hundred times more
  request_id: the one value that lets a support conversation start
rules:
  - one record per HTTP exchange, so a paged iterator produces one per page and states how many that was
  - a record is emitted whether the operation succeeded or failed, because a failed write is the interesting one
  - correlation fields come from the api:logger context, matching data:query-record
  - the record carries no attribute value outside the request body, and the body is gated
```
