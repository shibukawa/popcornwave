title: Middleware Runtime Config
---
The `middleware` binding selects and orders the Popcorn Wave middleware applied by Run and Middlewares.

```yaml
switches:
  - recovery
  - trusted proxy
  - request ID
  - OpenTelemetry root span
  - access log
  - request size and timeout limits
  - session and authentication
  - CORS, whose values live in data:security-runtime-config security.cors and whose frame is the response-header one, per requirement:cors-middleware
  - response compression
rdb_fields:
  rdb.enabled: bool
  rdb.default_group: group serving unpinned reads
  rdb.write_group: group serving framework-owned writes
  rdb.migration_group: group receiving migrations and seeds, defaulting to write_group
  rdb.connections: array of tables, one element per pool, modeled by data:database-connection-set
  rdb.connections[].group: string
  rdb.connections[].dsn: scheme://rest resolved by rule:rdb-dsn-resolution, such as sqlite://app.db, sqlite://:memory:, postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=verify-full, or mysql://user:pass@tcp(host:3306)/db
  rdb.connections[].readonly: bool
  rdb.connections[].connect_timeout: duration
  rdb.connections[].max_open_conns: non-negative integer
  rdb.connections[].max_idle_conns: non-negative integer
  rdb.connections[].conn_max_lifetime: non-negative duration
  rdb.connections[].conn_max_idle_time: non-negative duration
rdb_removed_fields:
  form: rdb.dsn plus rdb.connect_timeout and the four pool keys, with no connections element
  status: removed; one element is the only way to configure a database, however many there are
  migration: move the DSN and the pool bounds into a [[middleware.rdb.connections]] element, and read a deployment's value with a ${NAME} reference
toml_layout: every scalar rdb key must precede the first [[middleware.rdb.connections]] header
recommended_order:
  - recovery
  - browser response policy, which is security.headers and security.cors in one frame, placed here by decision:cors-above-the-refusals rather than beside security.csrf, so its marking is on every refusal below it
  - trusted proxy
  - request ID
  - root span
  - access log
  - limits and timeout
  - database pool
  - session and authentication
  - security.csrf
  - compression
  - application handler
rules:
  - policy:web-middleware defines interoperability with user middleware
  - the effective middleware set and order come from validated framework configuration
  - reject orders that violate required security or resource dependencies
  - enabled middleware validates its required config binding and linked implementation at startup
  - access logging and root-span middleware share data:observability-runtime-config
  - session middleware uses data:session-runtime-config and flow:session-lifecycle
  - CSRF, CORS, and response-header middleware use data:security-runtime-config
  - enabled rdb middleware uses api:rdb-middleware
  - each rdb DSN scheme resolves an opener and a dialect through rule:rdb-dsn-resolution, not a database/sql driver name
  - apply pool fields through database/sql without driver-specific assumptions
  - zero pool counts and durations retain database/sql zero-value semantics
  - per connection, max_idle_conns cannot exceed a positive max_open_conns
  - sqlite://:memory: requires max_open_conns 1 unless an explicitly supported shared-memory DSN is used
  - a server engine needs pool bounds sized against its own connection limit, which sqlite guidance does not imply
  - reject an unknown or unlinked DSN scheme, malformed DSN, invalid pool bounds, or failed startup ping on any connection
  - declaring both the legacy and the connections form is a startup error, not a merge
  - group pointers and per-connection validation follow data:database-connection-set
  - group assignment for framework-owned work follows policy:connection-group-selection
  - redact DSN credentials and sensitive query values from config views, logs, and errors
  - disabling a dependency of another enabled feature is a startup error
```
