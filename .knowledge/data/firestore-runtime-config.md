title: Firestore Runtime Configuration
---
The middleware.firestore section of data:middleware-runtime-config, registered by importing api:firestore-package and independent of middleware.rdb and middleware.dynamo.

```yaml
owner: api:firestore-package
registration: an independent binding, per decision:independent-runtime-config-bindings
fields:
  enabled: bool, default false
  project_id: required unless the environment supplies it; empty with no GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT and no DATASTORE_PROJECT_ID is a startup error
  database: optional; empty selects the project's default database, and a value selects a named one
  namespace: optional, default empty, applied to every key, per decision:firestore-namespace-isolation
  endpoint: optional; empty selects DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST if set and otherwise the Datastore host
  credentials: an enum naming the token source, since the driver's own default resolution covers one of four
  credentials_file: optional path, expanded from ${NAME}; empty falls back to GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
  timeout: duration, default 10s, the driver default restated so it is configurable
  max_idle_conns: non-negative int, default 4; guidance is to set it to the expected concurrency
credentials_values:
  service_account: the default; a self-signed JWT from the key file, with no token-endpoint round trip
  metadata: the GCE, Cloud Run and GKE path, which links no RSA code and reads no key file
  oauth2: a real access token from the token endpoint, for a deployment that requires one
  static: a token supplied by the process, for a device provisioned by a companion service and for tests
  why_it_is_configured_at_all: system:tinygodriver-firestore resolves GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and nothing else, so a deployment on Cloud Run would otherwise have no way to say that its credential is the metadata server
  rejected_auto_detect: probing the metadata server at startup to decide, which costs a round trip on every process that is not on GCE and silently changes the credential when a probe times out
no_schema_keys:
  absent: verify_schema and auto_migrate, both present in data:dynamodb-runtime-config
  reason: decision:firestore-no-schema-application; there is nothing to create and nothing that reports a kind's shape, so a key promising either would configure nothing
  what_is_there_instead: the startup probe of decision:firestore-datastore-mode-only, which is unconditional and has no key to turn it off, because it is one read and it is the only check available
no_naming_keys:
  absent: table_prefix and table_names
  reason: decision:firestore-namespace-isolation; a kind is intrinsic to the type and namespace is the one isolation dimension
no_ttl_keys:
  absent: anything naming expiry or retention
  reason: decision:firestore-expiry-policy; a TTL policy is applied out of band and the framework neither sets nor reads one
validation:
  - enabled true requires a resolvable project id, from this section or the environment
  - credentials service_account requires a resolvable key file, from credentials_file or GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
  - credentials static requires a token supplied in process, and a configuration naming it with none installed is a startup error rather than an anonymous client
  - credentials metadata and oauth2 accept no credentials_file, since neither reads one
  - an endpoint with no scheme is taken as http, matching the driver and the DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST shape
  - timeout is positive and max_idle_conns is not negative
  - an unreachable endpoint is a startup error naming the endpoint with credentials redacted
  - a database configured on an endpoint that is an emulator is accepted, since the emulator serves named databases
secrets:
  mechanism: ${NAME} expansion in TOML string values, the same file-layer mechanism data:database-connection-set uses
  rule: an undefined name is a load error rather than an empty expansion
  redaction: the credential file path is reported and its contents never are; a static token is redacted everywhere, per policy:startup-summary
  sharper_than_dynamodb: the credential here is a private key in a file rather than three string keys, so the redaction duty is about not reading the file into a report at all
scaffolded_development:
  endpoint: 127.0.0.1:8081, the address requirement:firestore-test-isolation starts the emulator on
  credentials: not configured; with the emulator endpoint set the driver sends no Authorization header, so a placeholder credential would be pretending to test the token path
  project_id: a placeholder value the emulator accepts
  rule: development-only values live in config.dev.toml and are never a deployment default
relation_to_other_stores: none; middleware.rdb absent with middleware.firestore enabled is valid, and so is every other combination, per requirement:firestore-store
```
