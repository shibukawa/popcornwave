title: Compression Runtime Config
---
The `middleware` compression bindings are the whole runtime surface of policy:response-content-encoding: whether to encode, and in what order to prefer the codings.

```yaml
fields:
  compression:
    type: bool
    default: false
    holder: MiddlewareConfig
    default_is_off_because: an application usually sits behind a layer that already compresses, and encoding a body twice helps no one
  compression_codings:
    type: ordered string list
    default: [zstd, gzip]
    holder: MiddlewareConfig
    means: which codings may be offered and which wins when a client accepts more than one
    empty_or_absent: takes the default; disabling every coding is spelled compression false, not an empty list
    validated_at_startup: an unknown token is a startup error, and a token whose encoder the build omitted is dropped with a warning rather than refused
why_the_order_is_configurable:
  - which coding to prefer depends on the deployment's client mix and CPU budget, which is the one input the framework cannot see; the shipped default is a judgment about typical traffic, not a fact
  - it is one field that also expresses removal, since a coding left out of the list is not offered, so it replaces a per-coding boolean rather than joining one
  - the shipped order is measured rather than arbitrary, per decision:response-content-codings, so an operator changing it is overriding evidence and should have their own
still_absent:
  fields: encoder level, minimum size, content-type list, etag
  reason: a deployment wanting those has a reverse proxy or CDN that already carries them, and this switch exists for deployments with no such layer
  level_specifically: fixed by requirement:response-gzip-encoder and requirement:contrib-zstd against a measured throughput cliff, so exposing it invites a setting that is slower for no gain
rules:
  - enabled selects one coding per request through policy:response-content-encoding, honoring this order over client q-value
  - disabled selects identity without parsing Accept-Encoding, and still emits no Vary of its own
  - a build lacking every listed encoder ignores the enabled value silently, so the build-time decision wins over the runtime one
  - independent from policy:public-asset-negotiation, whose representations are built rather than encoded per request and whose order is not configurable
```
