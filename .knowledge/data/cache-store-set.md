title: Cache Store Set
---
The framework-owned set of named cache stores, each configured as one `[[cache.stores]]` element and addressed by name at the call site, in the shape data:database-connection-set already uses for pools.

```yaml
status: built 2026-08-13 in pwruntime, bound as the cache section and aliased from pwconfig
owner: api:data-cache
why_named_and_configured:
  not_a_constructed_value: a store outlives every request, carries an operational size, and may address a process outside this one, which is the same set of properties a database pool has
  what_it_moves: ttl, stale window, scope, entry cap, and backend leave the call site, so a call names a policy rather than restating one
  what_stays_at_the_call_site: the key and the fetch, which are the only two parts a caller actually owns
store_fields:
  name: required, unique, ASCII lower-case letters, digits, underscore, hyphen, matching the group-name rule of data:database-connection-set
  backend: memory today; any other value names a process outside this one and is the seam rather than a shipped list
  dsn: driver://dsn for a backend that has one, redacted per rule:dsn-redaction
  ttl: how long an entry is fresh, required and positive
  stale: how long past fresh an entry may still answer while one revalidation runs, default zero, which disables the window
  scope: private or public, default private, per policy:component-cache-scope
  max_entries: non-negative, memory backend only, zero meaning unbounded
  fetch_timeout: bound on one coalesced fetch, default 30s; not in the first design and added by the build, because decision:data-cache-miss-coalescing detaches the fetch from every waiter and nothing else would ever stop it
validation:
  - enabled requires at least one stores element
  - a name must be unique across the set, because a call site addresses it
  - resolving a name the set does not hold is an error naming the configured stores, never a passthrough, since the alternative is a cache that quietly never caches; an application resolving its handle at setup per decision:memo-store-handle gets that failure at startup rather than on a first request
  - ttl must be positive; a store that stores nothing is a store nobody should have configured
  - stale must be zero or positive, and a positive one requires a backend that can hold two deadlines
  - max_entries is refused on a backend that does not evict locally
  - a backend with no dsn is refused unless it is memory, and memory refuses one
secret_input: the ${NAME} expansion of data:database-connection-set, for the same reason — an array element has no environment variable and no CLI option of its own, because its identity is its position in the file
lifetime:
  built: the set is keyed on a fingerprint of the configuration and rebuilt when that moves, exactly as the render store of requirement:component-output-cache is, so an operator resizes or disables without a restart and dropping the previous set is the eviction that change implies
  revised_from: an earlier reading that called the set immutable after startup on the model of a pool
  why_it_changed: only the memory backend exists, and it opens nothing; a set that could not be rebuilt would have cost a restart to resize while buying nothing back
  what_reopens_it: a backend holding a connection, which would want opening once and closing on replacement rather than being dropped
  cold_start_race: two goroutines can each build a set and one is dropped with whatever it collected, which costs a few repeated fetches once per process and needs no lock on a path every cached read takes
disabled: the whole section off means every Memo calls its fetch and returns, so a project removes caching without editing a call site
```
