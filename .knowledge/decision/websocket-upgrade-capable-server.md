title: pw Serves Through The Upgrade-Capable Server Itself
---
Serve the net/http build through the tinygodriver httpserver entry inside pw.Run rather than documenting it for the application, because this framework owns the bootstrap the module deliberately does not, and the failure it prevents is a hang with no log line.

```yaml
status: implemented 2026-08-11, per requirement:typed-websocket
constraint: system:tinybind-websocket tinygo_serving — TinyGo's net/http starts a background read before the handler and cancels it with a deadline netdev cannot apply to a recv already in flight, so Hijack blocks forever
symptom_if_unaddressed: the handshake hangs, the client times out, and the server logs nothing
module_stance_and_why_it_differs_here:
  module: documents the line and does not re-export, because the import edge would land in the graph of every net/http build to serve the ones with no socket
  here: pw owns pw/lifecycle.go, which already constructs the http.Server and the listener, so there is no application line to forget
  import_cost: pw/mux.go already imports tinygodriver httpmux, so the module is in pw's graph and this adds one package rather than a dependency
  host_go_cost: none; that entry sets a head timeout default and calls srv.Serve
change:
  from: "server.Serve(listener)"
  to: "httpserver.Serve(listener, server)"
  where: the serve closure of pw.Run
  second_build: unaffected, because RequestCtx.Hijack is a synchronous handoff with no background read
shutdown_must_be_fixed_with_it:
  found_2026_08_11: by reading the serving path, not by running it
  fact: on the TinyGo path that entry accepts on the listener itself and gives the http.Server an internal handoff listener instead
  consequence: "server.Shutdown closes what the server owns, which is no longer the real listener, so the accept loop keeps running and serveUntilContext blocks on a serve call that never returns"
  therefore: the shutdown path closes the listener itself rather than relying on the server to close it
  under_host_go: closing a listener the server also closes is harmless, so one path covers both
  severity: this turns a graceful shutdown into a hang, which is worse than the defect being fixed, so it is part of the change rather than after it
inherited_limits_worth_recording:
  first_request_only: only a connection's first request head is inspected; an upgrade arriving later on a reused connection is answered 501 rather than deadlocking, and a browser opens a fresh connection for a handshake
  bypass_writer: the hijackable writer implements Header, Write, WriteHeader and Hijack and nothing else, so api:typed-stream must never be routed through the bypass predicate
  predicate: the Connection upgrade token, so it covers a socket without naming one
  per_connection_cost_on_tinygo: one head read and a replay for every connection, including those of a build that opens no socket
unconditional:
  decided_by: owner, 2026-08-11
  what: every net/http bootstrap takes this path, whether or not the application opens a socket
  scope_of_the_cost: TinyGo only; the host Go entry is srv.Serve, so no ordinary deployment pays anything
  for: one bootstrap with nothing to configure, and no way to earn a silent hang by forgetting a flag
  against: a TinyGo deployment with no socket pays one head read and a replay per connection
  rejected_configuration_flag: forgetting it produces exactly the hang this change exists to remove, and pw.WebSocket is already the application saying it wants a socket
  deferred_alternative: a marker emitted by the generation pass that already discovers socket calls, which would cost nothing and cannot be forgotten
  why_deferred: the cost is unmeasured, and moving from here to that marker changes no published surface, so measuring first is free
```
