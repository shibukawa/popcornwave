title: Coalesce Data Misses On A Detached Fetch
---
Concurrent misses on one key run the fetch once, on a context detached from every waiter, reversing for data the refusal system:tinybind recorded for rendering.

```yaml
status: accepted and built 2026-08-13, covered by a test that cancels one waiter and shows the shared fetch still filling the entry
owner: requirement:data-result-cache
upstream_position: the component cache does not coalesce, on the stated ground that coalescing inside the runtime would tie one request's cancellation to another request's render
that_reasoning_is_sound_there: a duplicate render costs local CPU, so the cheapest correct answer is to let both run
what_changes_here:
  cost_asymmetry: a duplicate miss costs an upstream call, not CPU; concurrent misses on one cold popular key are a herd against the upstream, which is the failure a cache is bought to prevent
  policy: policy:layered-cache already required coalescing at the data layer and nothing had implemented it
mechanism:
  one_runs: the first waiter starts the fetch; every later waiter on the same key attaches to it
  detached_context: the fetch runs on a context derived from the starter's with cancellation removed, so it keeps values and loses lifetime
  values_that_must_survive: the authentication subject a private key was built from, and the trace context, both of which are context values rather than cancellation
  own_deadline: losing the caller's cancellation means the fetch has no bound, so the cache supplies its own timeout; without one a hung upstream leaks a goroutine per cold key
  waiters_stay_free: each waiter selects on its own context, so a request that goes away stops waiting and stops nothing else
  the_fetch_stores_its_own_result: not the waiter, because a waiter may cancel and a fetch every waiter abandoned would otherwise run to completion and discard what it produced, which is the one outcome detaching exists to prevent
  found_by: a test that cancels the only waiter, which had been passing on a timing accident until the rest of it was tightened
  ordering: store, then deregister, then wake, so a caller arriving in the gap finds either the flight or the entry and never neither
  second_gap: a caller misses and only then registers its flight, so a previous flight can finish in between; the flight re-reads the store before fetching, which is what makes concurrent misses run the fetch once rather than nearly once
  precedent: context.WithoutCancel already carries the rollback path in pwruntime and the shutdown path in pwfast, so this is the codebase's existing answer to work that must outlive its caller
why_this_answers_the_upstream_objection: the objection is that one request's cancellation reaches another's work, and detaching is precisely the removal of that reach; the upstream shape had the first caller own the fetch, and this one has nobody own it
consequences:
  span_parenting: a detached fetch cannot parent to a request span that may end first, so it links to the waiter that started it rather than nesting under it
  error_fanout: the fetch's error is returned to every attached waiter, so one upstream failure is reported as many
  revalidation: a stale-window revalidation uses the same path with no waiter at all, which is the case the detached context was going to be needed for regardless
rejected:
  x_sync_singleflight: it shares the first caller's context with every duplicate, which is the coupling being removed; its Forget and its shared-result flag would still leave that
  no_coalescing: matches upstream and leaves the herd, which is the one thing a data cache exists to stop
  per_waiter_timeout_only: the shortest waiter's deadline would then bound work the others need
```
