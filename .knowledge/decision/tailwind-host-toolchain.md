title: Tailwind Host Toolchain
---
Tailwind runs as an optional host asset tool; generated CSS is the only Tailwind artifact consumed by Go or TinyGo application builds.

```yaml
preferred:
  runtime: Tailwind standalone executable
  provisioner: Devbox
  package: pinned tailwindcss_4
  plugins: requirement:tailwind-plugin-integration
extension:
  runtime: user-managed Node.js toolchain
  purpose: plugins unavailable as standalone-compatible local ES modules
rules:
  - Node.js and JavaScript packages are absent from the target runtime
  - devbox.json and devbox.lock reproduce the selected Tailwind executable
  - builds never install tools or download plugins implicitly
  - reject a missing or incompatible CLI before writing CSS output
  - do not promise bare npm package resolution or arbitrary npm plugin compatibility
rationale: The Bun-compiled standalone executable removes the default Node project while local ES module plugins preserve Tailwind's standard CSS configuration model.
```
