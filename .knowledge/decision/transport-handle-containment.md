title: Transport Handles Stay Inside The Framework Surface
---
w and r are framework tokens: application code receives them, reads them, and hands them to pw, and never passes them to its own functions, stores them, or lets them outlive the handler.

```yaml
status: proposed
serves: requirement:alternate-http-backend-readiness
enforcement: rule:transport-handle-checks
shape: policy:request-scoped-accessor-shape
upstream_makes_it_a_gate:
  fact: decision:transport-compatibility-fallback records the reversal; a function the rewriter cannot take is a build error, not a slower route
  effect: this rule is the precondition for a fasthttp build rather than a budget against one
  softer_than_written_here: the upstream eligibility rule admits a transport value passed to a same-package function that is itself admitted, so a handler handing r to its own error or render helper is fine as long as that helper is analyzable too
  still_refused: a value passed outside the package, assigned, captured, address-taken, or type-asserted, which is what the store and outlive clauses above already say
the_rule:
  receive: a handler and a middleware take w and r as parameters, unchanged from decision:root-pw-api
  pass: to a framework surface within concept:public-package-boundaries, to the http.Handler seam a middleware composes with, or to a same-package function that is itself analyzable, per decision:transport-source-transform
  read: reading fields and calling methods on r stays allowed, because the minimum rule is about where the value goes, not about what is read out of it
  store: never into a struct field, package-level variable, map, slice, or channel
  outlive: never captured by a function that can run after the handler returns
  derived_context: a context.Context derived from the request carries a reference to it, so the same lifetime rule reaches the derived value; it is otherwise an ordinary context and may be passed anywhere
why_lifetime_belongs_in_the_minimum:
  fact: a pooled request value is reused after the handler returns, so a retained reference is a correctness bug and not only a portability one
  today: net/http tolerates it and nothing reports it, so the code that a pooled backend breaks is written years before that backend exists
  site: pw.Go takes a context bounding the work, and containment is what keeps the request value itself out of that closure
  refused_outright: a captured or stored transport value is refused upstream whatever else the function does, and the capture refusal outranks the recognized calls surrounding it
allowed_seams:
  - next.ServeHTTP(w, r) in a middleware, because that composition is what policy:web-middleware is
  - a *_pw_gen.go file, which is framework output and ports with the framework
  - a _test.go file, which constructs requests directly and is rewritten alongside any backend
stdlib_helpers:
  question: http.Redirect, http.Error, and http.SetCookie take w or r and are the helpers a handler actually reaches for
  evidence: examples/todo/popcornweb/handlers/todos.go calls http.Redirect three times, so the rule as written first failed this framework's own example
  redirect: api:redirect-response, a new pw surface, because the framework has a second reason to own it beyond portability
  error: api:problem-response through pw.WriteProblem, which already covers it and negotiates the representation http.Error cannot
  cookie: api:cookie-jar and api:session-registry, already shipped, so nothing new is owed here
  unaffected: pw internals keep calling the stdlib helpers, because pw is the layer that ports
transport_interfaces:
  question: http.Flusher, http.Hijacker, and http.Pusher are reached by asserting on w rather than by passing it
  flush: api:typed-stream owns it, and its callback form is what a handler writes instead
  hijack:
    surface: none, deliberately
    reasoning: what a handler wants from a flush or a hijack is almost always a stream, and api:typed-stream is that; what remains is a protocol that stops speaking HTTP after its handshake, and WebSocket is that case
    why_not_offered: a net.Conn is the rawest transport handle there is, so exposing one is the hole this decision exists to close
    and_it_is_the_wrong_seam_anyway:
      fact: github.com/fasthttp/websocket v1.5.12 is one package holding both server paths, Upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, header) returning a Conn and FastHTTPUpgrader.Upgrade(ctx, handler) taking a callback, and both build the same Conn through the same newConn
      consequence: the upgrader wants the request object, not a hijacked connection, so a hijack surface would sit one layer below where the seam belongs and would serve nothing
      correction: an earlier draft of this decision said a WebSocket library is backend-specific either way, and that is false; the post-handshake Conn and all of its methods are identical across the two paths
      shape: the two upgraders differ exactly as net/http and fasthttp differ everywhere else in this design, a returned value against a callback, which is the fourth surface to land that way
    consequence: a portable WebSocket route is available through that library's two upgraders, behind one callback-shaped seam
    placement_2026_08_08: requirement:contrib-websocket, so the seam would be an optional package rather than pw surface area
    placement_2026_08_11: requirement:typed-websocket, in pw and pwfast, because system:tinybind-websocket now publishes the seam and only a pw spelling survives the rewrite of decision:transport-source-transform
    seam_moved_up_a_layer: the callback receives a typed socket rather than the library's Conn, so this decision's no-raw-handle rule is satisfied more completely than the contrib plan would have satisfied it
  why_they_are_stricter: the upstream classifier refuses a type assertion on the transport by name, so these have no path through the rewriter at all
considered:
  - opaque wrapper types replacing http.ResponseWriter and '*http.Request', rejected because decision:root-pw-api keeps standard signatures and independent testability
  - a compatibility adapter for what the rule excludes, proposed here and rejected upstream, per decision:transport-compatibility-fallback
  - the convention documented without a runner, rejected because an unchecked convention decays between releases and is then discovered as a migration estimate
consequences:
  - the framework, not the application, owns every place the transport is named
  - a handler needing something pw does not offer becomes a request for a pw surface, which is the feedback this rule exists to produce
  - api:request-context-accessors must take the request handle, because a rule against passing r is livable only when passing r is what the accessors want
  - the cookie answer was already shipped, which is the shape to expect: the audit finds surfaces that exist more often than it finds ones that are owed
