title: Action Entry Point Selection
---
Emit both action lowerings on a form rather than selecting one set per build, so one project serves a browser with a runtime and one without from the same bytes.

```yaml
source: requirement:action-invocation-runtime, requirement:scriptless-action-forms, and the mode switch system:tinybind states in its own script-free render mode
review_gate: proposed
what_upstream_decided: one document-level mode chosen at generation, turning off every runtime-dependent feature at once, with the scripted set the default and the script-free set the alternative
why_the_module_made_it_exclusive:
  cost: the script-free set needs a selector, a POST registration on the page pattern, and a render-time channel carrying the concrete request path, and the scripted set needs none of them
  cloaking: serving different HTML by user agent is refused outright, so the switch had to be a build-time one
  cache_identity: the same component emits different markup in each mode, so output cached in one is invalid in the other
why_this_framework_cannot_take_it_as_offered:
  acceptance: requirement:classic-web-acceptance requires a build that works without the browser runtime, and requirement:modern-web-acceptance requires one that uses it; a per-build mode makes those two different deployments of one application
  the_ladder_disagrees: concept:interaction-cost-ladder prices interactivity per interaction, and a document-level mode prices it per build, so one page choosing a server action would decide the posture of every other page in the project
  the_existing_answer_is_per_request: pw/scriptless.go already answers a scripting-off browser at request time, and requirement:unified-update-runtime already treats the runtime as an optimization of behaviour the markup has, so a build-time mode is the only place in this design where the two clients need different bytes
chosen:
  form: emit the scriptless attributes and the runtime attribute together, so the markup performs the mutation by itself and the runtime intercepts it when present
  bare_element: emit the runtime attribute alone, since nothing in the markup can invoke it and no lowering changes that
  no_mode_setting: this framework configures no document-level switch, so a template compiles once and every project gets both
  cost_accepted: every project pays the selector, the page-pattern registration and the render-time path channel, whether or not any client ever submits without a runtime
why_this_is_not_the_rejected_middle_ground:
  what_upstream_refused: a combination of half-disabled client features, chosen per request
  what_this_is: one lowering set, always the same bytes, where the runtime's presence decides which of two mechanisms the same markup drives
  precedent_in_this_framework: requirement:unified-update-runtime already builds every fallback this way, as the absence of a code path rather than one more of them; a link works because it is a link and the runtime makes it faster
  cache_identity_unaffected: there is one mode, so the concern that output cached in one is invalid in the other does not arise
which_scriptless_shape:
  chosen: the page pattern, so the form posts to the page's own URL
  over: the direct /_action endpoint, which needs no registration and no channel
  why: the direct endpoint carries no path parameter, so a handler serving /users/{id} could not read the id from a scriptless submit while reading it from a scripted one; two entry points to one handler that disagree about what it can read is a contract an author cannot hold in their head
  second_reason: the address bar stays correct while an inline validation render is on screen, which the direct endpoint cannot do
  cost: the render-time channel carrying the concrete request path, which decision:runtime-tag-injection and requirement:module-native-csrf have already established as a place options are added above the shared builder
path_parameters_for_the_scripted_path:
  problem: the runtime posts to /_action/<hash>/<Name>, which holds no path parameter, so the scripted path has the hole the scriptless one does not
  chosen: the runtime posts to the page URL as well, naming the handler in the header it already sends for the action mode
  effect: one address, one set of readable parameters, and the direct entry point becomes the surface a client stub calls rather than the one a gesture uses
  what_it_costs: the direct entry point stops being what requirement:action-invocation-runtime issues, so the constant URL in the attribute becomes an identity rather than a target
  what_it_keeps: the endpoint stays registered and reachable, so a test, a client stub, and an application fetch still address a handler directly
  unresolved: whether the attribute should then carry the selector rather than the URL, which would make the two channels one string and is a change to what the system:tinybind lowering emits
  therefore: this is the half of the decision that needs system:tinybind agreement, and the form half needs only configuration this framework already sets
sequencing:
  first: the form lowering, since it fixes a form that is submitted as a GET today and closes the acceptance condition
  second: the runtime invocation, which makes a bare button work and is the ergonomics the ladder's authored-islands tier was promised
  why_that_order: the first is a correctness fix on shipped markup and the second is a new capability, and taking them the other way round leaves a scriptless client broken for longer
constraints:
  - one build serves both clients, so no configuration selects a lowering set
  - the handler contract is unchanged, since the system:tinybind action lowering profile fixes the signature, the hash, and the response rule
  - a form works with and without the runtime; a bare element works only with it, and nothing pretends otherwise
open_questions:
  - whether system:tinybind will emit both sets from one compile, or whether this framework supplies the second set through the profile seam system:tinybind already exposes
  - whether the runtime posting to the page URL needs a route registration distinct from the scriptless form's, given both are POSTs on the page pattern
```
