title: A Typed Action Is Declared
---
Admit a server action of an arbitrary signature by a declaration naming the function, because a shape rule cannot separate one from ordinary code when every exported function has a shape.

```yaml
source: requirement:typed-server-action, and the user's proposal 2026-08-13
review_gate: proposed
the_problem_it_solves:
  today: routetree admits an exported function taking exactly the transport types and returning nothing, so the signature is the whole admission rule
  why_that_works_for_the_raw_shape: it is unambiguous — a function of that shape in a route package is an action and nothing else plausibly is
  why_it_cannot_widen: an arbitrary signature is what every function has, so a rule over signatures admits everything or nothing
  therefore: something outside the signature has to say which functions are actions, which is what a declaration is
the_earlier_rejection_does_not_carry:
  what_was_rejected: system:tinybind considered a compile-time assertion admitting a handler, and refused it
  the_reason_given: it costs a declaration for every action to restate what the package boundary already says
  why_that_was_right_then: the shape was fixed, so the declaration bought only intentional exposure, and exposure is what the route package boundary already bounds
  why_it_lapses_here: the declaration is not restating the boundary, it is carrying the one fact the boundary cannot — that this function, of a shape nothing else distinguishes, is an action
  reading: the rejection was about a declaration with nothing to say, and this one has something to say
what_the_declaration_is_not:
  not_an_authorization: it admits a function to an address and grants nothing, so the function still authenticates and authorizes its own caller
  not_a_second_identity: the address stays the hash of the declaring directory and the function name, so nothing about addressing changes
  not_a_contract_restatement: it names the function and nothing about its signature, which generation reads from the function itself
the_two_rules_coexist:
  raw: admitted by shape, published by existing, per api:page-action-endpoint
  typed: admitted by declaration, published by nothing else
  why_that_asymmetry_is_honest: the raw shape is unambiguous and the typed one is not, so each is admitted by what can actually decide it
  cost: a reader asks two questions rather than one when looking for a route's actions, which the generated route table answers by listing both
form:
  spelling: this framework's, since the raw shape's spelling is already this framework's surface rather than the module's
  go_syntax: a package-level call expression is not legal Go, so it is an assignment to the blank identifier or a call inside init
  takes_the_symbol: generation reads which function this is from what it was handed, so that fact lives in one place and a rename is the compiler's work rather than an author's
  rejected_a_string_for_the_function: it would be a second place for the same fact to be wrong, and it could not fail to compile the way a symbol does
  and_optionally_a_published_name: a string saying what callers call it, which is a different fact rather than the same one twice — requirement:typed-server-action carries why, and the short of it is that a wire name is a contract with a caller where the symbol is a fact about this package
  placement: recommended in the file declaring the function, so a reader meeting the function learns it is published; generation reads the whole package, so this is guidance rather than a rule
  rejected_a_comment_directive: a magic comment carries no symbol, so a renamed function leaves a directive naming a string nothing checks — which is the untyped-URL failure this whole feature exists to remove, moved one file over
  rejected_a_struct_tag_or_naming_convention: a prefix or suffix rule is a shape rule again, and it would admit a function by how it was spelled rather than by what an author decided
constraints:
  - a declaration naming something that is not a function in the package fails generation
  - a project declaring none regenerates byte-identical output, so this reaches nobody who does not ask
```
