title: Response Content Codings
---
A dynamic response negotiates zstd and gzip; brotli exists only as a build-time sidecar, because its encoder is the wrong shape for a per-request path and the wrong size for a served binary.

```yaml
status: accepted
context:
  - decision:streaming-response-compression and policy:public-asset-negotiation both shipped zstd alone, so a client that does not advertise zstd receives identity bytes
  - zstd reaches Safari from Safari 26 on macOS Tahoe and Safari 26.3 on iOS, and comes from the OS network stack rather than the browser, so its coverage tracks OS upgrades and not browser updates
  - WebKit advertises br only over TLS, so a plain-HTTP origin sees gzip and deflate from Safari at every version, which is what makes br useless as the fallback
  - gzip is the only coding no browser, proxy, crawler, or non-browser agent lacks
measurement:
  caveat: one 22211-byte corpus of concatenated pw.html templates on darwin/arm64; a larger body favours zstd, whose window is 128 KiB
  method: encoder reset and reused, matching the sync.Pool path, so per-request allocation is zero
  dynamic_candidates:
    zstd_speedfastest: 420 MB/s, 30.0 percent of source
    zstd_speeddefault: 368 MB/s, 28.7 percent
    klauspost_gzip_1: 464 MB/s, 30.8 percent
    klauspost_gzip_6: 305 MB/s, 27.5 percent
    stdlib_gzip_1: 309 MB/s, 30.8 percent
    stdlib_gzip_6: 105 MB/s, 27.1 percent
    brotli_5: 86 MB/s, 25.2 percent
    brotli_11: 1.1 MB/s, 22.2 percent
  gzip_level_curve:
    shape: throughput falls monotonically with level while ratio gains flatten, so the useful range ends at a backend-specific cliff
    klauspost_cliff: between 6 and 7, where its own fast encoders give way to the generic path; 305 MB/s becomes 162 for 0.4 points of ratio
    stdlib_cliff: immediately after 1, since only level 1 uses the fast encoder; 309 MB/s becomes 165 at level 2
    huffman_only: fastest on both backends and worthless, at 60.9 percent
    chosen: level 1 on both, per requirement:response-gzip-encoder
  binary_delta_over_net_http:
    stdlib_gzip: 66 KB
    klauspost_zstd: 247 KB
    klauspost_gzip_beside_klauspost_zstd: 148 KB
    andybalholm_brotli: 795 KB
  tinygo_wasip1_total:
    stdlib_gzip: 835 KB
    andybalholm_brotli: 5.8 MB
decision:
  - negotiate zstd and gzip on every dynamic response, per policy:response-content-encoding
  - produce brotli, zstd, and gzip sidecars at build time, per policy:public-asset-precompression
  - link no brotli encoder into a served binary; only api:cli-build carries one
  - prefer zstd over gzip on the dynamic path, so a client already receiving zstd sees no change and gzip is purely additive
  - prefer brotli over zstd over gzip on the static path, which is pure ratio because build CPU is not request latency
  - encode shallow on the dynamic path and deep on the static one, because the same byte costs request CPU in one place and build CPU in the other
  - run the dynamic zstd at SpeedFastest, which puts it within a tenth of gzip level 1 on throughput and keeps it ahead on ratio
  - let a deployment reorder or drop a dynamic coding through data:compression-runtime-config, and let nothing reach the levels
rejected:
  brotli_on_the_dynamic_path:
    - brotli 5 costs 4.4 times the CPU of the shipped zstd to remove 8.6 percent more of the body, and brotli 11 is 350 times slower
    - andybalholm/brotli is a port of the C library and is slower than brotli benchmarked as C
    - 795 KB of encoder contradicts a project that already carries a build tag to remove a 247 KB one
    - a TinyGo target would need a bounded brotli encoder written from nothing, against a format carrying a static dictionary and context modelling, which is a far larger job than requirement:contrib-zstd was
  stdlib_gzip_on_the_host: 1.5 times slower at the chosen level 1, to save 82 KB in a binary already holding zstd
  a_deeper_dynamic_level: rejected on throughput; the gzip_level_curve above buys 3.3 points of ratio for a third of the host throughput, and a body already on the wire is not where request CPU should go
  deflate: ambiguous between raw and zlib-wrapped across implementations, and reaches no client gzip does not
consequences:
  - a served binary gains gzip and no brotli, so the encoder budget grows by 148 KB and not by 943 KB
  - the two dynamic codings both flush per settled boundary, so decision:streaming-response-compression generalizes rather than gaining a case
  - both dynamic codings now sit near 30 percent, zstd at 30.0 and gzip at 30.8, so the coding a client gets barely changes the bytes and the order is close to a free choice
  - the shallower zstd regresses ratio from 28.7 to 30.0 for clients already being served, which is accepted deliberately: the dynamic path is a throughput budget, and the deep levels live on the static path where they cost nothing
  - zstd stays worth its 247 KB, since it is both the better ratio and the newer format the default should be pointing at
  - both codings were once removable per tag; decision:response-encoders-are-unconditional records why that stopped being worth its own axis
verification: a request advertising only gzip receives a gzip body, a request advertising zstd still receives zstd, and no served binary links a brotli symbol
