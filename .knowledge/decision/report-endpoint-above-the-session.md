title: The Report Endpoint Is Answered Above The Session
---
requirement:browser-report-ingest is served at pwruntime SlotOperational, beside the probes, rather than as an application route with a configured exclusion, because a browser delivers reports with the visitor's cookies and without a token and every credential-shaped frame below that slot would read the request as something the visitor did.

```yaml
status: decided 2026-08-10 with the requirement, unimplemented
forcing_fact:
  spec: the Reporting API delivery request has fetch mode cors and credentials mode same-origin
  consequence: a same-origin endpoint receives the session cookie on a POST the visitor never made
  and: nothing attaches the security.csrf header or form field, because no page issued the request
slots:
  chosen: SlotOperational 100
  above:
    SlotSession 120: a report would otherwise resolve, touch and refresh a session, extending its idle expiry from traffic the visitor did not generate
    SlotAuthentication 130: a report carries no caller to verify and would establish a data:request-authentication for a request with no actor behind it
    SlotCSRF 140: policy:csrf-protection refuses every unsafe request with no valid token, so the endpoint would answer 403 to every report a browser sent
  still_covered_below_it:
    SlotAccessLog 40: the request appears in the access log like any other
    SlotRecover 50: a panic in the parser becomes a response rather than a dropped connection
    SlotRateLimitProcess 55: a configured process bound already reaches this endpoint
    SlotSecurityHeaders 60: the response carries the same policy headers as everything else
    SlotMaxRequestBody 80: the global cap applies, under the endpoint's own smaller one
  neighbour: it sits beside health and readiness for the same reason those do, which is that a caller with no session must reach them
rejected_alternatives:
  application_route_with_a_csrf_exclusion:
    shape: an ordinary handler plus security.csrf.exclude naming its path
    why_not: the exclusion is a line in a project's configuration that every project would have to write correctly, and forgetting it produces a 403 the operator never sees because the browser reports the failure to nobody
    also: it would still resolve and refresh a session per report, which the exclusion does not address
  a_second_listener:
    shape: a separate port for reports
    why_not: the endpoint must be same-origin for the browser to send credentials-bearing reports to it at all, and a second origin needs CORS preflight and a public hostname the application does not know behind a proxy
  csrf_exemption_inside_the_middleware:
    shape: policy:csrf-protection learns this one path
    why_not: it puts a framework route's name inside a general check, and leaves the session and authentication frames still running
consequences:
  - the endpoint is unauthenticated by construction and anyone can post to it, which is why requirement:browser-report-ingest bounds the body, the batch and the record rate rather than trusting the caller
  - the path lives inside the reserved /_pw/ prefix, so serveReservedPath closes it when reporting is off and no application route can claim it
  - both transports register the frame at one slot through pwruntime Compose, so the ordering that makes this correct cannot differ between them
  - a deployment that wants reports behind authentication cannot have them, because the browser is the client and it will not authenticate
```
