title: Event Binding Attribute Spelling
---
Spell a component-script event binding as a reserved hyphenated attribute of its own rather than reinterpreting an HTML event handler attribute, because the two readings of `onclick` are not distinguishable and one of them ships.

```yaml
source: requirement:component-script-event-binding
review_gate: proposed
the_question: what an author writes to bind an exported function to an event, given the obvious spelling is the one HTML already defines
candidates:
  reinterpret_on_click:
    shape: onclick="increment", read as a reference when the value is a bare identifier
    familiar: it is what an author reaches for first, and it needs no new vocabulary
    why_not_ambiguous_in_principle: a bare identifier is a valid JavaScript expression statement, so onclick="increment" already has a meaning, which is to evaluate a variable and discard it
    why_not_in_practice: the event attribute context rule of system:tinybind keeps a static on-attribute untouched, and its RawJavaScript escape hatch is shipped, so an on-attribute carrying authored JavaScript is a supported thing today
    what_reinterpreting_would_cost: the same failure system:tinybind records for the script block, where position alone could not say which of two readings a top-level script had, and taking it silently would have turned a shipped feature into literal text
    heuristic_rejected: distinguishing by whether the value parses as an identifier is a JavaScript question, and neither this framework nor system:tinybind reads JavaScript
  namespaced_colon:
    shape: on:click="increment"
    familiar: it is Svelte's, and the sigil forms of Vue are near it
    why_not: the system:tinybind template grammar requires static attribute names and the HTML parser's name grammar is what the template parser follows; a colon is a name character no standard attribute uses, so accepting it is a grammar question to settle upstream for one feature's ergonomics
    reconsider_when: the grammar admits it for another reason
  expression_in_an_on_attribute:
    shape: onclick={increment}, using the template's own insertion syntax so the name looks like something the compiler resolves
    attractive_because: it reads as checked, and decision:component-handler-namespace does intend the name to be resolved at generation
    why_not: the syntax is already taken; the event attribute context rule of system:tinybind makes an on-attribute a JavaScript insertion accepting trusted_javascript, so onclick={increment} today means insert the Go value named increment
    what_reinterpreting_costs: a project holding a trusted_javascript Go symbol whose name matches a script function changes meaning silently, which is the same class of reinterpretation this decision rejects one candidate above
    resolution_order_does_not_save_it: stating that the block wins over Go makes the collision decidable and leaves it invisible in the source, since neither name is written differently
    kept: the idea that the name is resolved and checked, which decision:component-handler-namespace carries on the reserved attribute instead
  a_second_sigil_for_client_expressions:
    shape: 'square brackets meaning a browser-side name where braces mean a server-side one: onclick=[increment] beside value={user.Name}'
    the_instinct_is_right: it makes the two namespaces visibly different in the source, which is exactly what the candidate above fails to do and what resolution order cannot repair
    why_not_the_blast_radius: a bracket is ordinary content in a way a brace is not; alt="[PDF]", a citation marker in prose, an attribute selector in a style block, and a filter[] query string are all things templates already contain, so a second active character needs a second escape rule and reinterprets existing text
    why_not_the_scope: an event binding is the only position where a browser-side name means anything, so a general expression sigil buys generality nothing asks for and charges for it on every character of every template
    why_not_the_owner: the sigil and its escape belong to the system:tinybind grammar shared by all three dialects of concept:template-source-dialects, where a bracket is a quoted identifier in some SQL dialects, so the cost lands in places unrelated to this feature
    buys_nothing_for_checking: whether a name is verified depends on reading the block, per decision:component-handler-namespace, and not on how the reference is spelled
    what_satisfies_the_instinct_instead: the attribute name itself, since a reserved hyphenated name is already visibly not an on-attribute and its value is a plain literal with no expression syntax to disambiguate
  client_action_mirroring_server_action:
    shape: client-action="increment", so the prefix names the side and the pair reads as one vocabulary
    asked: 2026-08-11, after settling that the two sides need different attribute names
    what_is_right_about_it: it is guessable with no framework knowledge, and it reuses the naming this framework already established
    why_it_does_not_fit: server-action needs no event because a server action is a destination and an element has one, with the trigger determined by the element — a form submits and a button is clicked; a client handler is a listener, an element may carry several, and most of them are not the activation event
    what_it_would_reduce_the_feature_to: the element's default activation only, so a box filtering as it is typed, a field validating on blur, and a dialog closing on Escape are all inexpressible
    the_suffix_repair: client-action-click, which carries the event but is long and breaks the symmetry at exactly the point the symmetry was for, since server-action has no suffix
    the_both_repair: client-action as sugar over on-click with the on-form for everything else, which is two spellings for one concept
    the_asymmetry_is_information: one is singular and event-free because there is one destination, the other is plural and event-bearing because there can be several listeners; a symmetric name would hide a real difference in shape
  reserved_hyphenated:
    shape: a plain hyphenated attribute name, parsed as an ordinary attribute everywhere and given meaning only where the lowering applies
    chosen: yes
    precedent: server-action is exactly this, reserved wherever a lowering applies, ordinary everywhere else, and never emitted
    second_precedent: that same grammar reserves slot as an element name while leaving it ordinary as an attribute, which is the same containment
    costs: it is one more name an author learns, and it does not look like the platform's
    buys: no ambiguity to resolve, no grammar change, no shipped meaning taken away, and a diagnostic that can name the attribute because nothing else writes it
legibility_of_the_side:
  the_concern_client_action_was_answering: on-click does not say browser the way server-action says server
  why_it_is_smaller_than_it_looks: the on prefix is universally read as a browser event, and server-action states its side outright, so the pair communicates the split without being symmetric
  closed_by_a_diagnostic: a name in an on-attribute that resolves to an exported Go handler in the route package and to nothing in the component's script is reported with server-action named in the message, which is the one confusion the asymmetry could produce
consequence_for_the_inline_form:
  unchanged: an on-attribute keeps meaning what it means, so an application that has one goes on working
  still_broken_under_the_csp: an inline handler needs an allowance policy:security-response-headers is designed not to give, which is a fact about the deployment and not something this decision changes
  worth_a_check: rule:route-and-template-checks reporting an on-attribute in a component that declares a script block, since that is almost always an author reaching for the wrong spelling
  not_an_error: refusing it outright is a policy judgement about whether applications may use inline handlers, and system:tinybind already took the narrower position of making the type honest and leaving the choice to the author
aligning_the_two_sides:
  asked: 2026-08-11, whether one attribute should serve both, with on-click="increment" naming a client handler and on-click={Rename} naming a Go one
  what_is_right_about_it: it is teachable in two lines, and the quoting genuinely can carry the distinction, since a reserved attribute's value is under the lowering's control and never means ordinary insertion there
  what_it_would_cost:
    upstream_owns_the_name: server-action is system:tinybind's reserved spelling, documented and shipped, so renaming it is an upstream negotiation on top of the parser one this feature already needs
    the_event_is_not_a_free_parameter_server_side: a form's is submit and a bare button's is click, so the event name is either redundant or the only option, and carrying it admits shapes needing diagnostics
    it_opens_the_trigger_model: on-change={Save} reads as legal under a shared name and would post on a select change, which works only with a runtime and reopens the split decision:action-entry-point-selection just closed for forms
    a_shared_name_hides_the_round_trip: server-action says this leaves the browser and on-click says this runs here, which is the asymmetry a reader benefits from
  recommendation: keep two names, align the grammar and the naming convention rather than the name; the unified form stays available and its blocker is ownership rather than aesthetics
  either_way: rule:template-behavior-attributes records that exactly one signal has to distinguish the sides, and both shapes satisfy it
value_form:
  rule: a quoted literal is a name the lowering resolves; a braced expression is a value from the template's own Go scope
  already_true: concept:template-source-dialects makes braces the insertion and everything else literal text, so this needs no grammar change and no second sigil
  applied_here: the handler attribute takes a quoted literal, and an expression in it is a generation error, exactly as system:tinybind forbids one in server-action for the same reason — a computed value cannot be resolved or checked at generation
  the_tempting_generalization_is_wrong: reading quoting as browser-side against server-side does not hold, because server-action="Rename" is a quoted literal naming a Go symbol
  the_rule_that_does_hold: quoting says whether the value is a name or a value, and the attribute says which namespace a name is resolved in
  why_that_is_enough: the front-and-server distinction the bracket sigil was reaching for is carried by the attribute, which is where it was always going to have to live, since one attribute means one namespace
naming:
  constraint: it must not collide with an author's own attribute, an ARIA attribute, or a custom element's property
  candidates_not_settled_here: the exact word, which is worth choosing with the documentation rather than in isolation
  requirement: the event name is part of the attribute rather than part of the value, so a diagnostic and a template check can read which event is bound without parsing a value
constraints:
  - the authored attribute is never emitted, so nothing an author writes reaches the browser as-is
  - the value stays a static string literal, so no expression machinery is involved
  - the name is reserved only where the lowering applies, and stays an ordinary attribute name elsewhere
```
