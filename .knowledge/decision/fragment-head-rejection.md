title: Fragment Head Rejection
---
api:html-fragment-response fails a fragment that carries head contributions instead of dropping or inlining them.

```yaml
status: accepted
rule: a non-empty leaf head is a 500 api:problem-response before the first byte, logged as a programming error
detection:
  read: htmlbind Fragment.Head() from system:tinybind, before rendering
  covers: the leaf's own head element and every component it calls statically, since the compiler folds those contributions into the calling plan
  gap: a Fragment supplied at runtime through a Params field contributes no head and is therefore not detected either, the same known gap decision:automatic-async-render-selection records
  cost: one slice length check, no allocation
rejected_alternatives:
  silent_drop:
    what: render the fragment and discard the merged head, which is what htmlbind.Render does on its own
    why_not: a component style block is scoped into the head, so the region would swap in unstyled with no error in any log
  inline_emission:
    what: write the contributions inside the fragment body, where a browser does apply a style or stylesheet link
    why_not: every swap re-emits them, nothing owns or dedupes them against the tags the initial document already holds, and the head ownership and diff design that would settle this is still upstream design work
  head_side_channel:
    what: carry the contributions in a response header or envelope for a client to apply
    why_not: that is an envelope, and the envelope path is flow:partial-refresh; requirement:html-fragment-rendering exists precisely to have none
consequence:
  scope: any component with a scoped style or script block is unusable anywhere inside a fragment leaf, including nested several levels down
  reason: contributions fold upward, so the check cannot distinguish the leaf's own head from a child's
  workaround: the swapped markup relies on styles the initial document already loaded, so those declarations belong to a component the document renders or to a shared stylesheet
  visibility: the failure is loud and pre-commit, so it surfaces on the first request rather than as an unstyled region in production
revisit_when: system:tinybind gains marked, identity-diffable head tags, which would make inline emission or a side channel safe to apply repeatedly
```
