title: Scriptless Browser Detection
---
A browser with scripting disabled keeps every fallback of a streamed async page, and a noscript redirect to the same page under a marker parameter is what makes such a client receive the buffered document instead.

```yaml
status: built; html.scriptless_detection, on by default, and the guards below are what it consists of
what_made_it_small_this_time:
  fact: the head contribution channel of decision:runtime-tag-injection did not exist when this was first attempted, so the block had nowhere to come from but an application template
  effect: one new file, one config key, and one branch in the render entry, against the sprawl that stopped it before
  where_it_lands: the MergedHead op a document shell places inside its head element, which is also why a fragment response contributes nothing
scope: the streaming branch of requirement:async-html-rendering, which requirement:live-html-rendering also takes; requirement:query-navigation-interception needs none of it and is unaffected
why_it_was_open:
  fact: decision:bot-client-classification serves crawlers and CLI clients and excluded this case, which requirement:bot-synchronous-render recorded as rare and degraded on purpose
  not_already_rejected: the rejected javascript_challenge of that decision says a script cannot ask a scriptless client anything, which is true and does not cover a noscript challenge, since noscript is the one HTML feature that activates precisely when scripting is off
  spec_is_on_its_side: noscript is permitted in head with link, style, and meta content, so a meta refresh inside it is valid rather than a trick
shape:
  emit: a noscript meta refresh in the head, targeting this same page under a marker query parameter
  marked_request: renders buffered, sets the marker cookie, and omits the block
  cookie_present: renders buffered and omits the block
  contributed_by: the head channel of decision:runtime-tag-injection, so no application template carries it and no shell edit can drop it
  what_the_reader_sees: the page they asked for, complete, one round trip later and at the same path
corrected_objection:
  claimed: that the first view stays broken because the client is redirected off the page it asked for
  wrong_because: the target is that same page, so the redirect lands on the rendered buffered document rather than away from it; only the first request is discarded, never the first view
  why_recorded: the argument was decisive while it stood, and a decision holding a refuted argument is worse than one holding none
guards:
  when_to_emit:
    conditions: an await or live block is present, the streaming branch was selected, the client is not classified a bot, the method is safe, and neither the marker parameter nor the marker cookie is present
    integration_point: the head options of the document path are assembled before the await and bot probes run, so the contribution belongs after them rather than in the existing builder
  no_loop: the marked request renders buffered from the parameter alone and emits no block, so a client with cookies also disabled terminates rather than cycling
  cookies_off_cost: one extra round trip per page rather than once per client, since every link on the page points at a clean URL
  safe_methods_only: a meta refresh re-issues a GET, so a non-GET response emitting one would discard the validation errors or receipt it just rendered
  bots_never_see_it: a classified bot is already on the buffered branch, so no crawler reaches a marker URL and there is no duplicate representation to canonicalize
cookie_is_an_optimization:
  fact: the parameter alone makes the mechanism correct; the cookie only removes the extra round trip on later pages
  consequence: it can ship second, or not at all, which is most of what made this look like sprawl the first time
  self_healing: a request carrying both the cookie and the parameter can answer with a redirect to the clean URL, so a marker URL does not outlive the client's first page
surviving_costs:
  one_discarded_render: the aborted first request already ran the handler and started its boundaries, so a scriptless client costs two handler executions on its first page, and two per page while cookies are off
  bookmark_residue: a reader who bookmarks during that one page captures the marker parameter, and keeps the buffered branch if they later enable scripting
  cache: an await-capable response varies on the marker cookie as well as on the User-Agent decision:bot-client-classification already added, and only where the block would otherwise be emitted, so a page with one representation keeps a response that varies on nothing
  render_bound: a marked request waits for every boundary before any byte, so it takes the longer bot bound rather than the streaming one it can never benefit from
  meta_refresh_may_be_disabled: a browser or extension that blocks automatic refresh leaves the streamed page with its fallbacks, which is today's behavior rather than a worse one, so the failure mode is the status quo
what_live_gets:
  not_updating: no design here can push without a script, so a live region stops being live
  but_not_nothing: the buffered branch renders a live boundary from its first delivery per requirement:bot-synchronous-render, so a scriptless reader gets a real snapshot instead of a fallback that never resolves
rejected_alternatives:
  inverted_cookie:
    shape: buffered until the runtime proves scripting is on by setting a cookie, then streaming
    appeal: no detection, no redirect, no marker URL, no discarded render
    why_not: the cost lands on every client's first view rather than on the population being served, and that first view is the cold visit where streaming is worth the most; taxing everyone to fix a rare case is the wrong distribution
  emit_both_representations:
    shape: send each settled boundary twice, once as the template the runtime consumes and once inside noscript
    why_not: every client pays the second copy, and the settled markup arrives at the end of the document rather than where the region belongs, so a scriptless reader gets the content after the footer
  noscript_link:
    shape: a visible noscript block offering a link to the buffered representation
    why_not: correct, trivial, and unused; it asks a reader to understand a rendering mode before they can read the page
  streaming_false:
    shape: the existing configuration key, which forces the buffered branch for every client
    still_the_answer_for: a deployment whose whole audience runs without script, at no maintenance cost
    why_not_sufficient: it is site-wide, so it cannot serve an operator who has both audiences, which is the case this decision exists for
criteria:
  - a scriptless browser reaches the complete rendered page at the path it asked for, one round trip later
  - a scriptless browser with cookies disabled reaches it too, and never cycles
  - a scripted browser sees no block, no marker, and no extra request
  - a classified bot is unaffected, and no marker URL is ever reachable by one
  - a non-GET response emits no block, so a rendered POST result is never discarded
  - a client whose browser blocks automatic refresh sees exactly what it sees today
```
