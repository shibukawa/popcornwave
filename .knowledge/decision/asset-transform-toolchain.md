title: Asset Transform Toolchain
---
Every converter reachable from system:pw-cli is pure Go or a wasm module a pure-Go runtime executes; anything else is an external tool on the decision:tailwind-host-toolchain terms.

```yaml
status: accepted 2026-08-04
constraint:
  source: requirement:cli-distribution builds with cgo disabled and cross-compiles five targets from one runner with no C toolchain
  consequence: a cgo image codec would end single-runner cross-compilation for every target at once, which is a larger loss than any encoder is worth
options_in_order:
  in_process_pure_go:
    preferred: true
    identity: covered already, because the generation input hash includes the generator executable
  in_process_wasm:
    form: an encoder compiled to wasm and run by a pure-Go runtime inside pw
    cost: encode throughput and memory against a native encoder, paid once per asset and then cached by the conversion cache
    identity: the module bytes ship inside the executable, so the executable hash still covers it
  external_binary:
    form: a Devbox-pinned tool invoked per conversion, as Tailwind already is
    terms: reject a missing or incompatible tool before writing anything, and never install or download implicitly
    identity: the resolved path and reported version are hashed explicitly, because the executable hash does not see them and a silent tool upgrade would be a --check failure with no stated cause
javascript_and_css:
  chosen: esbuild, a pure-Go library, for the typescript build and the stylesheet minify
  fit: its metafile lists what it read, which is the read set requirement:derived-asset-pipeline reports, so nothing infers a dependency graph
  status: adopted; a css module imported by an entry becomes the companion file the head contribution loads
images:
  chosen: cwebp and avifenc, on the external-binary terms above, with the resolved path and reported version in every cache key
  provisioning: the api:cli-add images capability writes both packages into devbox.json and turns the conversion on together, so a project cannot end up with the switch and not the tools
  platform_fallback:
    tool: sips, which ships with macOS
    writes: lossy avif only
    does_not_write: webp, which it reads only; measured 2026-08-04, where a webp conversion exited zero and produced no file
    lossless_is_a_lie:
      measured: 2026-08-04, sips accepts "formatOptions lossless" and writes a lossy file anyway; a png round tripped through it returned with pixels differing by up to 8 across most of the image, where avifenc --lossless returned byte-identical
      consequence: the candidate list is per axis as well as per format, and sips is unreachable from the lossless one
      why_it_matters: a png is authored exact, so a screenshot, a diagram, or a logo re-encoded lossily is a visible defect that no size check and no diagnostic downstream would catch
    consequence: the candidate list is per format and per axis rather than per platform, and a listed tool that cannot honor either would be worse than no fallback
    identity: sips carries no version of its own, so the OS is what identifies it in a cache key
  axis_is_the_source's:
    rule: a png converts on the lossless axis and a jpeg on the lossy one, for both webp and avif
    avif_is_capable: avif has a lossless mode and avifenc --lossless is genuinely lossless, so preferring avif for a png costs nothing in fidelity
    stock_mac_consequence: with neither encoder installed, a jpeg still gains a lossy avif variant and a png gains nothing, which the build report names per file
  no_encoder:
    behavior: the conversion declines with a reason and the authored image ships as written
    why_not_a_failure: an unconverted image is a larger page rather than a broken one, unlike a script build, whose absence would leave a page naming a file nobody produced
    reported: rule:production-readiness-checks, as a warning naming the formats this machine cannot write
  measured_2026_08_04:
    what: the cgo-free Go encoder available today, nativewebp v1.3.0, lost the size comparison against Go's own png encoder on a solid fill, a checkerboard, a gradient, and noise, at both default and best compression
    consequence: an in-process encoder that always declines is an encoder that does nothing, so the external tier is where this actually lands
    contrast: libwebp beat png on every one of the same images, including noise
  refused: a wasm-backed encoder whose loader prefers a system library when one is present, since two machines would then produce different bytes and --check would fail on the difference between two correct builds
  criteria:
    - cgo-free and clean on every requirement:cli-distribution target
    - encode quality and speed acceptable at build time, since a cold conversion is serial
    - license compatible with the Apache-2.0 artifact and its existing MPL-2.0 notice
    - webp first, because policy:asset-transform-matrix needs it for both the png and the jpeg case, and avif only where it earns its bytes
  note: decode is stdlib for png and jpeg, so only the encode side is open
rules:
  - no codec, compiler, or wasm runtime enters the application runtime; every one of them is a host build dependency of system:pw-cli
  - a project registering no transform links none of it at runtime and pays nothing at build time
  - a conversion is deterministic for one toolchain version, and a version change is a hashed input rather than a silent difference
```
