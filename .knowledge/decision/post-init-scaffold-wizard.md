title: Post-init Scaffold Wizard
---
api:cli-add and api:cli-new reuse the decision:interactive-project-bootstrap wizard but drop its shortcut-flag parity, because they edit a project that already exists and the review screen is the only place that edit is approved.

```yaml
status: accepted
supersedes: the decision:interactive-project-bootstrap non-goal that reserved the wizard for api:cli-init
shared_machinery:
  steps: the same ordered step list, conditional steps, review screen, and key bindings
  library: github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea, host-only per decision:host-tools-target-runtime
  reuse_cost: a command supplies its own step list and its own scaffold branch; the wizard model is untouched
argument_form:
  accepted: pw add [capability] and pw new [kind], where the argument preselects the first step
  effect: the wizard still runs, and the review screen still has to be accepted
  omitted: a leading selection step lists the capabilities or kinds the project can still take
no_flag_parity:
  rule: no flag combination and no --yes skips the wizard for these commands
  reason_init_differs: api:cli-init creates a fresh directory, so a scripted run risks nothing that existed before
  reason_here: these commands edit configuration, migrations, and sources a project already depends on, and a wrong answer is discovered after the write
  no_terminal: print usage and fail, instead of guessing answers
review_screen:
  init: lists the answers
  add_and_new: lists every file to create, every file to append to, and every follow-up command
  reason: the operator approves the effect on their project, not just the answers that produced it
rationale:
  - one wizard implementation keeps question style, navigation, and cancel semantics identical across commands
  - a mandatory review turns an irreversible scaffold into a reviewed change
  - refusing scripted use is cheap now and reversible later, while a scripted write that damaged a project is not
non_goals:
  - a non-interactive mode for api:cli-add or api:cli-new
  - remembering answers between runs
  - a wizard for commands that only read or run, such as api:cli-generate and api:cli-dev
```
