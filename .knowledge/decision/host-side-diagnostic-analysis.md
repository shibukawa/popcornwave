title: Host-Side Diagnostic Analysis
---
requirement:project-diagnostics inspects the project from outside with host tooling, and neither builds nor runs the application.

```yaml
status: proposed
decision:
  actor: system:pw-cli alone
  inputs:
    - the data:project-config project files
    - the environment configuration file policy:config-file-resolution selects for the diagnosed token
    - the resolved import graph of data:project-config project.main
    - the generated configbind metadata api:cli-generate already wrote for the generate.config purpose
  excluded: no application build and no application process, ever; no network or database connection unless the api:cli-doctor online option asks for one
  checks: decision:shared-check-catalog, so a condition startup also validates is one definition rather than two
  precedent: decision:host-tools-target-runtime already places Go AST analysis on the host, so this is the phase that reads source
registration_discovery:
  mechanism: resolve the import graph, then analyze the registration call sites in each reachable package, the way rule:static-route-discovery reads route registrations
  reads: pw.RegisterConfig prefixes, api:session-backend-plugin backend names, api:framework-extension registrations, and database/sql driver registrations
  scope: a third-party plugin is discovered the same way as a first-party one, because the analysis reads the package rather than a catalog inside the CLI
  blank_imports: a blank import is an edge in the graph like any other, which is what makes decision:import-registered-session-plugins statically visible
  unresolvable: a registration behind a value the analysis cannot resolve becomes a limits entry, never a missing-import finding
provenance_boundary:
  layers:
    defaults: read from the generated configbind metadata
    file: the TOML the diagnosed token selects
    environment: this host's own process environment, read as a layer and marked as coming from this host
    cli: never determinable, because doctor's arguments are not the application's
  host_modes:
    workstation: the deployment's variables are absent, so a field they would carry is undeterminable and its advisories are suppressed
    deployment: a CI job or deployment shell that already holds those variables makes the same fields determinable, and the required-value checks become real
    detection: the CI environment variable, which is what a pipeline sets and a workstation does not
    distinction: doctor states which mode it ran in, because the same clean report means different things in each
  handling: an undeterminable value is reported as unknown at this host per data:diagnostic-report, never as its default
  honesty: running the application binary on a workstation would not recover the deployment's environment either, so this boundary is a property of where the command runs and not of how it collects
rejected:
  in_process_action:
    idea: a framework option making the application binary report its own registry, collected by the CLI
    why_not: it costs a build, it fails exactly when the project is broken, its code would ship inside the binary under rule:tinygo-runtime-compatibility, and it still cannot see the deployment's environment variables
    deferred: it remains the only way to observe a live process's actual resolved state, including reachability probes, and is left for a later need
  toml_schema_only:
    idea: validate the configuration file against a schema
    why_not: a key's owner and a missing plugin import are invisible without the import graph
consequences:
  - the diagnosis is instant, side-effect free, and works on a project that does not compile
  - any environment can be diagnosed from any host, because no secret of that environment is needed
  - accuracy depends on the generated configbind metadata being current, so api:cli-doctor runs the api:cli-generate drift check first and downgrades the configuration sections when it fails
  - framework binding metadata is read from the popcornweb module version in the project build list, not from the version compiled into the CLI, so a CLI newer than the project does not report keys the project does not have
  - the analysis models what would be registered instead of observing it, so every gap it cannot resolve is stated as a limit
```
