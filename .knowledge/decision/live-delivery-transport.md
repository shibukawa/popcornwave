title: Live Deliveries On The Page Route
---
Carry live deliveries on the page's own route, selected by a request header, and frame each delivery as a record rather than as markup.

```yaml
status: accepted and implemented
shipped:
  header: Pw-Response-Mode, with the token live; pw.ResponseModeHeader and pw.LiveResponseMode name them
  media_type: application/x-ndjson, one record per line
  entry: api:html-response reads the header before choosing a branch, so every page route answers both modes with no generated code change
  uncompressed:
    decided: a live response is not compressed, where a document still is
    why: flushing every few seconds keeps the ratio poor and emits a sync marker per delivery, and a long-lived stream mixing personalized content with request-influenced values offers a compression oracle far more samples than one document does
    revisit: when a measured deployment shows the bandwidth mattering more than either
  streaming_carries_it: a buffered document settles its live boundaries in place and writes no placeholder, so html.streaming false disables live mode rather than leaving a client applying deliveries to ids that address nothing
source:
  - requirement:live-html-rendering
  - the system:tinybind live transport and response mode designs, neither of them implemented upstream
problem:
  document_must_end: the document response ends when every request-owned boundary settles, and a browser that never reaches load completion has a wrong loading state, no back-forward cache eligibility, and middleware that never observes completion
  reconnect_has_no_home: a dropped document response can only be recovered by re-requesting the whole document, which repaints regions the user asked to leave alone
chosen:
  route: the page's own URL and the generated route, requested again with a live mode header
  body: the route executes normally and writes no document bytes; htmlbind.RenderChainLive takes io.Discard as its writer and only deliveries are transferred
  framing: newline-delimited records from htmlbind.Content.AppendJSON, per api:live-delivery-protocol
  duration: open for as long as the subscription lives, bounded by policy:live-subscription-bounds
  multiplexed: one response carries every live boundary of that page, so a dashboard with several live regions costs one connection
reconstruction_is_execution:
  mechanism: the route handler, its layouts, and its page run again for the same URL and the same credentials, so every live binding sees the arguments it saw before
  identity: htmlbind boundary ids are positional and repeat across executions of the same chain, so the ids line up with the placeholders already on screen with nothing sent to align them
  no_continuation: no token, no server-held subscription state, and no client-held arguments
  cost: the page's own work runs again per connection, including await boundaries whose results are discarded; policy:live-subscription-bounds counts it
  handler_constraint: a page handler must be safe to execute again for the same URL, which is what a GET already promised
why_a_header:
  same_path: routing, authentication, parameter binding, and the handler are the ones already generated and already tested; the mode changes what is written, not what is computed
  no_url_change: the page renders from its own path and search parameters, so a mode token must not appear among them
  csrf_synergy: a simple cross-origin form or link cannot set a custom request header, which is exactly the class policy:csrf-protection targets
  extensible: a mode is a registered token, so flow:partial-refresh could become a mode later rather than a second endpoint
  vary_required: every mode-capable response sends Vary on the mode header, because a shared cache that stored a delivery stream under the page URL would serve it where a document was expected
  unknown_token: answered as the ordinary document, so an older client against a newer server stays functional
rejected_separate_endpoint:
  shape: a caller-authored live channel route beside every page, addressed by boundary handle
  why:
    - it doubles the route surface and lets the live path drift from the document path
    - with no page execution behind it, it needs a capability token to prove what a client may watch, which the header makes unnecessary
    - its correctness would depend on generated identity rules the application does not own
rejected_endless_document:
  shape: hold the document response open for the life of the screen
  why: the document never completes, a dropped connection has no selective resume, and the connection is pinned for the session against per-origin connection limits
transport_shape:
  chosen_first: chunked response read as a fetch stream, because it carries the CSRF and mode headers a browser cannot attach to an EventSource
  rejected_sse: EventSource sends no custom header and no credentials the same way, so the mode and the token would have to move into the URL
  compression: decision:streaming-response-compression applies, and flushing per delivery over a long-lived stream is a poor ratio and a compression-oracle surface worth stating; see policy:live-subscription-bounds
delivery_record:
  today: id and HTML, which is what htmlbind yields; a delivery replaces the whole boundary subtree
  later: operations and a revision, once boundary-level diffing exists, which is the same record grown rather than a different one
  no_markup: past the initial document no parser is reading, so the template-and-marker framing of api:html-boundary-protocol has nothing to trigger
open_questions:
  - the header name and the live token spelling, and whether they are shared with a future navigation mode
  - whether the mode is read by generated route code or by a framework wrapper installed around it
  - whether a live-mode execution can skip the await boundaries whose output is discarded, which needs a plan slice htmlbind does not yet expose
```
