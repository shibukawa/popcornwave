title: Middleware Is Written Once Per Backend
---
Every framework middleware ships an implementation per backend, selected by build tag; an application middleware is backend-specific source that the application writes again, and neither kind reaches decision:transport-compatibility-fallback.

```yaml
status: proposed
serves: requirement:alternate-http-backend-readiness
set: policy:web-middleware names the framework middleware, and all of them are ported rather than a selected subset
why_middleware_cannot_be_adapted:
  handler_case: adapting one handler costs that handler, which is what makes the fallback a per-route budget
  middleware_case: a middleware wraps everything below it, so its adapter's next is a net/http handler and the whole downstream chain is inside the adapter with it
  consequence: one adapted middleware at the top of the stack drags the entire application onto the slow path, and the per-route granularity the fallback is built on stops existing
  therefore: middleware is native on each backend or it is not on that backend at all
framework_middleware:
  coverage: the full set, so a project does not discover that its stack is half-ported
  form: one implementation per backend behind one build-tagged name, so data:middleware-runtime-config and the configured order are unchanged
  cost: paid once by the framework, per middleware, which is the trade the whole design makes
application_middleware:
  originally_here: no portability promise at all, on the reasoning that a middleware body is mostly headers, status, and connection handling, the part of the two backends that agrees least
  superseded: by the block below, since the transform reaches a middleware the same way it reaches a handler
  seam_is_still_legal: next.ServeHTTP(w, r) remains an allowed use of w and r under decision:transport-handle-containment
upstream_changed_both_halves_2026_08_09:
  application_middleware:
    was: backend-specific source with no portability promise, written again per backend
    now: subject to the same eligibility test as a handler, so an analyzable middleware is transformed like one and only a refused one needs a second copy
    why_it_moved: the transform closes over the same-package call graph, and a middleware is an ordinary function to it
    what_survives: the whole-chain reasoning below still explains why no adapter could have covered it, which is the reason upstream shipped none
  framework_middleware:
    unchanged: both backends supplied, with composition order verified identical across the pair
    but_cheaper: the upstream framework-tag-boundary guidance keeps one import path and tags the type rather than its users, so a function whose signature names only framework types stays single-copy even where the type is defined twice
    the_move: define the handler and middleware types under a build tag, and leave the registration, option, and ordering code untagged; only code reaching into the request needs two versions
    propagation: an untagged function may call a tagged one only while the callee's signature is identical under both tags, and the moment it is not, the caller is tagged too
    test: if tagging spreads past the request-handling layer, a signature that could have been transport-free is not, and making it so is cheaper than the second copy
    correction: this decision estimated the full middleware set as the largest single item of framework work, and the tagged-type arrangement makes it markedly smaller than that
considered:
  single_source_over_aliases:
    what: writing each middleware once against build-tagged pw handler and middleware aliases
    blocker: the two backends spell a handler differently in kind, an interface with ServeHTTP against a function taking one value, so an alias covering both forces a function type whose net/http form takes two parameters and whose other form takes the same pointer twice
    judgment: the abstraction would be paid in every middleware body to serve neither backend well, where two native files are each simpler than the one shared file
  adapting_application_middleware: rejected above, on the whole-chain cost
settled_by_the_transform:
  question_was: whether framework middleware is transformed rather than hand-written twice
  answer: application middleware is transformed on the same terms as a handler; framework middleware stays a supplied pair, because it is the layer defining the tagged types rather than a user of them
  still_true: a middleware calling next.ServeHTTP calls an interface method where the other backend's next is a plain function, which is exactly why the type is what carries the tag
value_propagation_measured_2026_08_10:
  the_worry: a net/http frame changes what the rest of the chain sees by deriving a context and handing it on, and the other transport has one request value a frame cannot derive, so the recording half of every frame looked untranslatable
  what_was_measured: RequestCtx.Value answers from the same user-value store SetUserValue writes to, so a value written in place is read by an ordinary ctx.Value lookup
  consequence: every reader in the shared leaf already works on both transports, and only the write side needed anything; that is one function rather than a second copy of each reader
  shape: the writer is typed by a structural interface naming context.Context and SetUserValue, so the leaf still names no type from the fasthttp fork
  first_frame: RequestID, whose shared half is the rule for what a client-supplied identifier may contain -- shared because it is a security check, the value arriving from the client and leaving in a response header, so a second copy of the rule would be a second chance to get it wrong
consequences:
  - an application middleware is reported by rule:transport-handle-checks on the same terms as a handler, because the transform treats them the same and a separate entry would imply a remedy that differs
  - a frame's portable part is what it decides rather than how it wraps, and the wrapping is the only part written twice
  - a project intending to port keeps its own middleware analyzable, which the report makes concrete instead of leaving to taste
  - the framework middleware set is still work this framework pays once, but the tagged-type arrangement makes it smaller than the estimate this decision first carried
