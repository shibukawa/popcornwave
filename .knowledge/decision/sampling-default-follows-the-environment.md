title: The Sampling Default Follows The Environment Token, Not The Endpoint
---
requirement:trace-head-sampling defaults to recording everything under data:runtime-environment dev and to a ratio under every other token, because flow:telemetry-export now has a route that sends straight to a collection backend and that route has nothing downstream to shed volume for it.

```yaml
status: accepted 2026-08-17
supersedes: the parentbased_always_on default this requirement was first written with, which assumed a collector between the process and the backend
what_changed:
  fact: a direct route to the collection backend is in scope, per the routes section of flow:telemetry-export
  consequence: on that route the process is the last place a span can be declined, so the default it ships with is the default the bill is computed from
  compounding: data:framework-span-set opens a render span, an initial build, one per boundary, one per delivery, and one per statement, so the direct route bills per span and a request is a dozen of them
  no_second_chance: tail sampling stays available only on the collector route, so a direct deployment that records everything has no later stage that can change its mind
decision:
  dev: parentbased_always_on
  every_other_token: parentbased_traceidratio
  ratio: 0.1
  explicit_wins: an operator setting trace.sampler or OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER replaces the default, and the default is never consulted again
  parent_based_on_both: a valid remote parent decides either way, so an upstream service that recorded is never truncated by a downstream ratio
dev_is_the_exception:
  rule: the always_on branch is dev alone; stg, prod, and any extension token data:runtime-environment permits all take the ratio
  why_that_direction: an unknown token is a deployment somebody added, and the safe reading of an unfamiliar environment is that it carries traffic
  not_stated_as_prod_samples: the mirror-image spelling would leave every extension token recording everything, which is the expensive branch reached by not thinking about it
why_this_is_not_a_feature_switch:
  the_rule: data:runtime-environment states that the token is data rather than a feature switch and that behavior keys off explicit configuration fields
  respected_how: this selects the default value of an ordinary configuration field, which is the shape stdout_format already uses when it defaults to plaintext in dev and json everywhere else
  test: with trace.sampler set, the token changes nothing; a switch would still be read
rejected:
  derive_from_the_endpoint:
    shape: sampler auto, resolving to always_on for a loopback receiver and to a ratio for a remote one, matching how otel.enabled is already derived from the endpoint
    attractive: it puts the cost decision next to the fact that causes the cost, and requirement:dev-telemetry-viewer would keep always_on with no environment rule at all
    fatal: loopback does not mean local here. decision:local-tls-proxy-boundary puts a proxy in front of a deployed listener, and the same shape sends telemetry through a local address to a remote backend; a sidecar collector is also a loopback address that should record everything
    therefore: the address answers neither question reliably, and a rule that is right for a sidecar and wrong for a proxy is worse than one that does not look at the address
  require_an_explicit_sampler:
    shape: a remote endpoint with no sampler fails startup, so the framework guesses nothing
    fatal: requirement:contrib-otel ships today with no sampler concept, so every deployment currently exporting to an endpoint would stop booting on upgrade over a value it never had to state
    also: refusing to serve traffic because a cost preference is unstated inverts the severity of the two problems
  keep_always_on_and_document_it:
    shape: leave the framework default at the other SDKs' value and make the direct route's guide require a ratio
    fatal: the direct route is the one being added, so this leaves the expensive branch as the one a deployment reaches by following the new path without reading it
    residual: the guide still states it; the disagreement was only about whether the guide is the mitigation
consequences:
  - policy:startup-summary must name the resolved sampler, its ratio, and the provenance that says default-by-environment, since one trace in ten and a broken tracer look identical from outside
  - a stg deployment gets a ratio where a complete trace was probably wanted, which is the cost of one rule for every non-dev token; the key overrides it in one line
  - this framework's default differs from the always_on the OpenTelemetry SDKs ship, deliberately, because their default counts one span per operation and data:framework-span-set counts a dozen per request
  - requirement:framework-metrics is unaffected, per decision:metrics-are-not-sampled; a deployment on the ratio still counts every request, which is what makes the ratio survivable
  - requirement:dev-request-timing-surface keeps working with no rule of its own, because its gate already depends on trace.enabled and dev resolves to always_on here
  - the ratio is the value most likely to be edited by a first real deployment, and nothing else in this decision depends on the number
