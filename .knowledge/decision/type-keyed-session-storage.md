title: Type-Keyed Session Storage Registry
---
Session state is declared statically as a Go type with a scope and read back by that type, because an application holds several independent pieces of per-browser state and the framework already resolves configuration this way.

```yaml
status: accepted
state: designed, per api:session-registry
problem:
  single_payload: session.Manager[T] carries one T, so a second piece of session state has to be folded into the first application struct or invented elsewhere
  plumbing: a session.NewJar value has to reach every package that reads the cookie, so the cookie name and its codec travel through constructors
  divergence: a jar and a session store are the same question about the same browser, answered through two unrelated APIs
choice:
  declaration: pw.RegisterSessionStore[T](key, scope) from main
  retrieval: session.Load[T](ctx) and session.Value[T](ctx)
  precedent: pw.RegisterConfig[T](prefix) and pw.Config[T](ctx), which an application already uses and which has the same startup-declared, request-read shape
why_the_type_is_the_key:
  no_string_lookup: a misspelled name is a compile error rather than a missing value
  no_container: a package reads its own state without importing the package that owns the layout
  shape_is_static: the codec, the size bound, and the placement are decided once at registration, so no request-time branch chooses them
  sharing_is_visible: two packages sharing a slot must share the type, which shows in the import graph
placement_at_registration:
  reason: what the client may do with a value, and whether it must be revocable, are properties of the value rather than of the deployment, so they are written where the type is
  deployment_share: which server backend to use, per decision:slot-declared-placement
  effect: moving a value from client-writable to server-only changes one registration line
rejected_alternatives:
  - a string-keyed map on the session, which loses the static shape and gives every reader the whole session
  - keeping session.Manager[T] and asking applications to compose one struct, which couples unrelated features and makes every write rewrite the whole payload
  - constructing a store or a jar per feature and passing it, which is the current shape and puts cookie names in constructor signatures
  - registering from init, which cannot see configuration and would fix an ordering the framework does not control, for the reason api:runtime-configuration already gives
naming:
  collision: session.Store[T] and session.RawStore already name the persistence contract, so RegisterSessionStore names a slot while Store names a backend
  resolution: the persistence contract is described as a backend throughout api:session-store and api:session-backend-plugin, and the registered unit is a slot
  accepted: yes; the call site reads as registering storage for a type, which is what an application means
consequences:
  - session storage no longer implies login, per concept:session-storage-boundary
  - a session exists for an anonymous browser as soon as anything is written, per api:session-registry issuance
  - api:cookie-jar narrows to a cookie deliberately kept outside the session
  - one destruction rule covers every slot, because they share one token
```
