title: A Data Entry Is Identified By Its Key Type
---
The identity part of a data cache key is the key type's qualified name alone, emitted into the method decision:cache-key-interface requires, joined with the build identity by the store.

```yaml
status: accepted and built 2026-08-13; revised twice — from a caller-declared name to the key type, then the version dropped entirely when system:tinybind v0.5.9 refused it
owner: requirement:data-result-cache
what_the_component_cache_does: its identity is the component's package, file, and name joined with a digest of the instruction list generated for it, so edited markup cannot read entries the previous build wrote
why_that_does_not_carry: the digest exists because a template compiles to a plan; a hand-written fetch compiles to nothing the framework reads, so an edited function body is invisible and would keep answering from entries written by the code it replaced
identity:
  type_name: the key type's package path and name, which is unique by construction; emitted by cachekeybind and never restated by an author
  build: the pwruntime UpdateBuildID that api:html-update-options already carries, which is the vcs revision, joined by the store rather than by the method
  where_it_lives: the type name inside the generated method, the scope and the build in front of it, so nothing at the call site restates any part
no_version:
  was: an author-declared version beside the type name, to cover a meaning change that leaves the key alone
  removed_by: system:tinybind v0.5.9, whose own decision is that a version relocates a failure rather than closing one — it is a number an author must remember to raise, and forgetting it is silent
  the_argument_that_lands_here: the upstream module states that its cache runtime never enumerates or invalidates entries, so a version is an invalidation lever declared in a library for a policy the deployment owns
  why_this_framework_loses_little: the build identity above already invalidates on any code change, which is the common case; the residual is a meaning change with no code change
  residual_answers: namespace a store per release, delete the scope prefix as a range, or wait out the TTL
  accepted: the earlier framing here, that a hand-written body needs a declared equivalent of the plan fingerprint, is withdrawn
why_the_type_and_not_a_declared_name:
  the_collision_it_prevents: a store is addressed by name at the call site, so two Memo calls sharing a store would key on their arguments alone; a user key holding 1 and an order key holding 1 would reach one entry
  cannot_be_forgotten: a caller-declared name is a string an author picks per call site, which is both forgettable and duplicable, and the failure is a wrong answer rather than a build error
  cannot_be_duplicated: a package path plus a type name is unique in a build, so two key types cannot collide however they are named
  cost: caching two different results under one key type now requires two key types, which is the honest reading of two different dependency sets
why_both_remaining_parts:
  build_alone: partitions on deploy, which covers an edited fetch for free on any real rollout, and says nothing about which call site an entry belongs to
  type_alone: separates call sites and says nothing about time
  together: the deploy invalidates code changes and the type keeps two call sites apart, and neither is a number anyone has to remember
unstamped_binary:
  fact: UpdateBuildID is empty when the binary carries no vcs revision, which is the go run and buildvcs=false case
  consequence: the build part contributes nothing, so entries written before a rebuild are readable after it
  acceptable_for_memory: the process restarts when the binary is rebuilt, so the entries are gone before the question arises
  not_acceptable_for_a_remote_backend: a development binary would read a previous build's entries out of a store that never restarted, so data:cache-store-set must answer this before a second backend ships
  not_fixed_by_a_process_identity: a per-process value would partition every restart and never match a second replica, which is a cache that answers nothing in production to fix a development case
schema_version: policy:layered-cache names one on the data layer; it is answered by the build identity and the type name together rather than by anything an author declares, per no_version above
rejected:
  hash_the_function: Go offers no stable digest of a function body at run time, and one taken at build time would need a generator over hand-written code
  hash_the_result_type: it moves on a field rename that changes no meaning and holds still on a semantic change that renames nothing
  identity_from_the_call_site: file and line move on every edit above them, so unrelated changes would evict
```
