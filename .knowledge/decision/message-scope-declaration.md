title: Message Scope Is Declared in the File
---
A template names its message scope in a header declaration, so an ID never derives from a file path and the declaration doubles as the catalog's sharding key.

```yaml
status: proposed
source: user discussion 2026-08-16
spelling:
  header: "messages about, one per file, in the shared header of concept:template-source-dialects"
  meaning: import-like; it names the namespace this file's "{t ...}" references resolve against
  grammar: a new declaration form rather than an annotation, so it is file-scoped rather than attached to one declaration
  upstream: decision:upstream-message-surface item A
default_scope_and_qualified_ids:
  bare: "{t title} resolves to about.title"
  qualified: "{t common.save} leaves the declared scope"
  rule: the declaration sets the default, and a dotted ID escapes it, matching a package-qualified name in Go
  cost: no new grammar for the qualified form
rejected_alternatives:
  path_derived:
    why_not: moving a component between directories renames every ID in it and orphans the translations, with nothing in the diff naming the change
  component_name_derived:
    why_not: survives a move but collides across files, and a rename for unrelated reasons still moves the IDs
  annotation:
    shape: "@i18n(scope: \"about\") before the component declaration"
    why_not: costs no upstream grammar, but an annotation precedes a declaration, so a file with several components repeats it
    kept_as: the fallback if the header form proves expensive upstream
what_the_declaration_buys:
  catalog_sharding:
    fact: the declared scope is the catalog file boundary, so messages/about.yaml follows the scope rather than an arbitrary split
    effect: translators working on separate features do not contend on one file
  shared_messages:
    mechanism: two files declaring the same scope reference one catalog entry
    why_no_collision: the text lives in the catalog per decision:message-source-of-truth, so two references are two reads of one definition rather than two definitions
    replaces: a dedicated global namespace, which is not needed
  no_derivation_to_remember:
    check: a file containing "{t ...}" and no messages declaration is an error
    effect: the ID of a reference is readable from the file rather than inferred
rename_cost:
  what: renaming a scope renames every ID under it and orphans the translations
  bound: it is one deliberate edit visible in the diff, unlike a directory move
  tooling: api:cli-i18n detects the orphaned scope and offers the rename
typo_is_self_reporting: a misspelled scope resolves to IDs no catalog defines, which fails as an undefined reference
```
