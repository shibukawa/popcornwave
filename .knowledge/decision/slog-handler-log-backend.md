title: slog Handler as the Log Encoder
---
api:logger is a framework type with scalar attributes, and log/slog is used underneath it as the stdout encoder rather than as the API.

```yaml
status: accepted
problem: the framework passed *slog.Logger through pwruntime.Resources, every middleware, and every accessor, so the logging API was slog's and could not carry trace correlation or OTLP routing
api_is_not_slog:
  - attributes are scalars only, so a record can never fail to encode while a request is being served
  - one Attribute type is shared with requirement:contrib-otel spans, so a value annotates both without conversion
  - no Fatal or Panic, because logging must not decide whether the process lives
  - correlation is captured at acquisition, which slog has no place for
slog_is_the_encoder:
  - JSON and plaintext already exist and are tested upstream
  - an application can substitute any slog.Handler it already uses
  - severity numbers are slog's, so a substituted handler filters correctly with no mapping table
  - it works under TinyGo, per decision:tinygo-042-baseline
tinygo_limit:
  fact: runtime.Callers is a stub, so slog silently omits source locations
  consequence: no severity, field, or acceptance criterion of api:logger depends on a source location
sink_shape:
  contract: Sink.Emit receives a finished Record; the backend holds a severity floor and an ordered sink list
  nil_discipline: a constructor returns the Sink interface, because a typed nil pointer in an interface is not nil and would make an unconfigured destination look configured
  correlation: the OTLP sink restores the captured span on the context before emitting, since the provider reads correlation from there and the severity methods take no context
group_removal:
  fact: policy:startup-summary previously used nested slog groups
  now: dotted keys, because a record attribute is a scalar and the same record has to survive OTLP export
```
