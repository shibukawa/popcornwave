title: How a Template Position Reaches Go
---
Carry the requirement:template-source-positions mapping as Go //line directives inside the generated file, rather than as a side-car map only Popcorn Web's own tools could read.

```yaml
status: accepted and implemented upstream at system:tinybind v0.5.17, with the path form settled by measurement rather than by the first answer
problem:
  - a mapping only api:cli-lsp reads helps the editor and leaves the compiler, the runtime, and the debugger reporting generated positions
  - the tools that most need it are the ones Popcorn Web does not own
decision:
  form: //line directives emitted by api:cli-generate at the start of every span whose origin is a .pw.* source
  path_form: >
    absolute. Measured against go1.26.5 rather than reasoned about, because the
    first answer here was wrong in both directions
  path_form_evidence:
    module_root_relative: go vet resolves a relative directive against the directory of the file holding it, so pkg/sub/home.pw.html doubles into pkg/sub/pkg/sub/home.pw.html and names nothing
    base_name: vet resolves it correctly; go build prints the directive verbatim, so a deep package reports only home.pw.html with no directory
    absolute: vet and go build both shorten it against the working directory, so both report pkg/sub/home.pw.html
    trimpath: -trimpath rewrites a line directive's absolute path exactly as it rewrites any other, so a release stack frame reads lt/pkg/sub/home.pw.html and the binary carries no machine path; the earlier claim that it does not was measured false
    committed_packages: decision:committed-package-artifacts tracks a component package's generated Go, so an absolute path there would churn the diff per machine; that project keeps the directives off, which is what makes them a per-project setting
  granularity: one directive per emitted span with a template origin, and a directive restoring the generated file's own position when the span ends
  unmapped: generator scaffolding keeps its own position, so a bug in the generator is still reported where it was written
why_line_directives:
  - the Go compiler, go vet, the runtime's stack trace, delve, and gopls all honor them, so one emission changes every reader at once
  - they are the mechanism Go's own generators use, so no tool has to be taught anything
  - they need no file to distribute, which keeps policy:generated-artifacts intact: the mapping is regenerated with the file that carries it
costs:
  debugging_the_generator: a position inside a mapped span now names the template, so a generator author reads the emitted file with directives suppressed
  coverage: >
    worse than attribution. The profile keeps the generated file's path and writes
    the mapped line numbers, so it names line ranges past the end of that file;
    go tool cover -html paints the wrong lines and exits zero. There is no
    reporting to choose between, only a broken profile, and the cause is in
    cmd/cover rather than in the emitter
  formatting: a directive is column-sensitive, so the emitter places it rather than gofmt
  error_text_growth: none; the directive replaces a path rather than adding one
settled:
  release_builds: kept. -trimpath already strips the machine path, so a release stack frame names the template by its module-relative path and exposes nothing requirement:deployed-debug-information objects to
  coverage: the directives and go test -cover are mutually exclusive. A project taking one gives up the other, which is why the setting is per project and off by default
  suppression: the setting is the suppression. A generator author reads the emitted file with it off
  per_project_not_per_command: generation output must not depend on who ran it, or api:cli-check reports drift on every machine that differs; the switch therefore lives in data:project-config and never on a command line
rejected:
  side_car_map:
    shape: a JSON map beside the generated file, read by api:cli-lsp and by api:error-renderer
    rejected_because:
      - the compiler and the debugger, which is where most of the pain is, would keep reporting generated positions
      - it adds an artifact class policy:generated-artifacts would have to place, version, and ignore
      - the editor is the one consumer that could already do this mapping itself, since it has the parser
  status_quo:
    shape: keep mapping positions per diagnostic inside api:cli-generate
    rejected_because:
      - it maps only what the generator itself reports, which excludes every error the Go compiler and the runtime produce
      - requirement:editor-navigation and requirement:editor-diagnostics both want the mapping for positions the generator never inspected
```
