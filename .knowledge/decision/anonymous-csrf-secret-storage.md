title: Anonymous CSRF Secret Storage
---
A visitor with no session gets a CSRF secret carried in a signed cookie rather than a session record, because minting a stored session for every anonymous visitor lets unauthenticated traffic write unbounded rows.

```yaml
source: user question 2026-08-03, on where an anonymous token lives
question: where an anonymous visitor's secret is stored, and whether each one gets a session id
answer_to_the_second: no; a session id per anonymous visitor is the option this decision rejects
rejected_session_per_visitor:
  shape: create a data:session-record for any visitor that reaches a page needing a token
  why_not:
    amplification: any unauthenticated request to a page with an unsafe form writes a row, so a crawler or a scripted client sets the row count, not the user base
    storage_reality: the record lands in the requirement:state-storage-tiers backend a project chose, so the cost is a real write against SQLite, Valkey, or DynamoDB
    collection: those rows expire rather than being deleted on logout, since there is no logout, so the store carries them for a full session lifetime
    no_benefit: nothing in the record is used; only the secret is read, and the secret does not need a row to exist
    precedent: Django keeps the CSRF secret out of the session by default for this reason, and makes the session-stored form an explicit opt-in
chosen:
  shape: the secret is the cookie, authenticated by the server rather than looked up
  mechanism: the signed mode of policy:cookie-value-protection, written and read through api:cookie-jar, which is implemented and carries plain, signed, and sealed modes with a keyring already
  why_that_mode_exactly: it is defined as a value the client may see but not choose, which is this value's requirement stated in advance; the runtime must read the cookie, and nothing may mint one
  nothing_new_invented: the keyring, its purpose-separated subkeys, its rotation rule, and the binding of a value to its cookie name all come from that policy rather than from a second key this decision would otherwise have added
  storage: none; verification recomputes the signature instead of reading anything
  not_naive_double_submit: policy:csrf-protection forbids the unsigned form precisely because anyone who can set a cookie can then satisfy it; the signature is what closes that, and the policy already names the signed variant as the stateless option
  cookie_prefix: the host-locked prefix, so no subdomain and no sibling host can write it, which is the remaining way a double-submit shape is attacked
  requires: secure transport and a root path, which the prefix enforces rather than merely recommending
  expiry: the absolute stamp the signed mode carries inside its authenticated payload, so a stale secret is refused whatever the cookie attributes say
two_populations_one_verification:
  authenticated: the secret stays in the data:session-record field that already exists, so revocation, expiry, and rotation come from the session
  anonymous: the secret comes from the signed cookie
  shared: everything after obtaining the secret is identical, since requirement:csrf-token-lifecycle derives the emitted token and recomputes the expected one the same way for both
  transition: logging in rotates the session and issues a new secret, so a token minted before authentication cannot be presented after it
  why_not_unify_on_the_cookie:
    tempting: one mechanism, and it is what Django does
    why_not_here: the session record already carries the field, and a session-held secret dies with the session on the server, which a cookie-held one cannot; keeping it means revocation actually revokes
    cost_accepted: two ways to obtain a secret, behind one function
opt_in:
  default: off, because policy:csrf-protection requires a validated session on a protected unsafe request and most deployments have no anonymous unsafe form
  turned_on_by: a project that serves its own unsafe form to visitors without a session, such as a contact or search post
  effect_when_off: a render with no session and an unsafe form still fails rather than emitting an unprotected field, which is the behaviour requirement:module-native-csrf already describes
  not_the_login_flow: the shipped authentication mode puts the credential form at the provider and protects the callback with its own state parameter, so this is never what login needs
bounds:
  no_growth: one cookie per browser and no server state, so anonymous traffic costs nothing to remember
  rotation: the anonymous secret is replaced whenever the cookie is absent or fails its signature, which is also what makes an expired one self-healing
  no_identity: the secret identifies nothing and is not a tracking value; it carries no user, no session, and no history, and policy:query-log-safety keeps it out of diagnostics like any other secret
as_built:
  where: inside the CSRF middleware rather than beside it, so issuance runs before the safe-method check
  why_there: a GET is what renders the form the token goes into, so a middleware that only ran on unsafe requests would issue the secret one request too late
  two_cookies: the signed one holds the secret and stays http-only; the ordinary token cookie beside it is what the runtime reads, so an anonymous page drives an update exactly as a session one does
  self_healing: an absent, expired, or unsigned cookie is replaced rather than refused, since there is nothing to protect yet and a visitor whose cookie aged out would otherwise be stuck
  precedence: a session secret already in the request wins and no anonymous cookie is written
  startup: enabling the path with no signing secret fails rather than writing an unsigned cookie
acceptance:
  - an anonymous visitor posting an unsafe form succeeds without any row being written
  - a cookie the server did not sign is refused
  - a subdomain cannot write the cookie, because the prefix forbids it
  - logging in replaces the secret, and a token minted beforehand is refused afterwards
  - a deployment that never enables this behaves exactly as it does today
  - the anonymous path and the session path share one verification, differing only in where the secret came from
```
