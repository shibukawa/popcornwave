title: Page Render Binding
---
Generated page handlers reach the pw response path through symbol repointing and the one render block system:tinybind v0.2.5 added, so no whole-file generation template is replaced.

```yaml
status: accepted
problem: the built-in render call writes htmlbind.Render into an io.Writer, which has no request and therefore no document shell, bot classification, streaming choice, encoding, or error page
seam_history:
  v0_2_4: the render call was fixed inside the handler block and the composer file, so pw had to replace the handler block, the composer template, and the registry template
  v0_2_5: the render call is the named render block, the composer entry takes a configurable writer and an optional request parameter, and the router type is its own symbol pair
  v0_2_6: the failure entry is a symbol rather than a fixed selector, and the generated header is settable with a paired prefix to register with discovery
  effect: this decision now uses only the cheapest tier system:tinybind advertises, symbols plus one block
symbols:
  http: net/http, which the decoder needs for Request and PathValue
  mux:
    type: MuxType names the api:page-render-runtime router interface, written verbatim, so an interface needs no pointer
    constructor: an empty MuxConstructor omits the constructor, which is right for a type generated code cannot build
    import: MuxImport is left empty, because the registry adds the mux import beside the runtime one without checking whether they are the same package, and the runtime import is already there
  runtime: RuntimeImport is api:page-render-runtime, supplying the wrapper type, the option type, and the render entry
  error: ErrorImport is pw itself, with WriteError set to WriteProblem and BadRequest and Problem already spelled the way pw spells them
  why_two_packages: the error values are pw's ordinary public API and need no wrapper, while Option and Wrapper cannot come from pw because Option there is already the api:application-lifecycle option
  constraint: generated page code imports net/http, pw, and api:page-render-runtime only, never system:tinybind
composer_entry:
  RenderWriterType: http.ResponseWriter, because the pw response path chooses status, encoding, and framing
  RenderRequestParam: declared, so a handler-rung Load composes its layout chain through the same entry
  imports: derived by the emitter from the signature, so naming the type is the whole configuration
replaced_block:
  render: the api:page-render-runtime entry taking the writer, the request, the chain, and the leaf
  chain_not_wrappers: the block reads Chain rather than Wrappers, which is nil for a page with no ancestor layout, so one call shape covers both cases without a branch
  error_typed: the block must yield an error expression, because the generated caller writes it through WriteError; this is why the entry returns an error even though the pw response path already answers a failure itself
kept_defaults:
  error_block: unchanged, because pw.Problem already carries the Code and Message fields the default block writes and pw.BadRequest returns a Problem value given one
  decoder: unchanged
  registry: unchanged, including its variadic render options, which api:page-render-runtime appends after the values api:html-response derives from data:html-render-config
generated_names:
  component_suffix: _pw_gen.go, so page.pw.html and layout.pw.html emit page_pw_gen.go and layout_pw_gen.go
  decoder: route_pw_gen.go
  registry: routes_pw_gen.go
  reason: policy:generated-artifacts already excludes **/*_pw_gen.go from version control and the editor, so the tree needs no new ignore rule
generated_header:
  rule: page tree output carries the Popcorn Web header api:cli-generate writes elsewhere, and the emitter's paired prefix is registered with the discovery pass
  why_registration: discovery skips a generated file by header prefix, and it recognizes only system:tinybind's own; an unregistered generated registry is analyzed as hand-written code, which turns every page registration into a documented route
  pairing: the prefix comes from the emitter rather than a second constant, so the registered string cannot drift from the header
  since: v0.2.6, which made the header settable; before it the only safe choice was keeping the upstream header
  second_guard: the pages purpose keeps no OpenAPI artifact, per flow:page-route-generation, so the exclusion holds even if the registration is lost
reserved_file_names: page.pw.html, layout.pw.html, document.pw.html, and page.go, configured rather than defaulted because system:tinybind names them .tb.html
action_attribute: data-pw-action, so the framework runtime rather than an external library owns the lowered attribute
inherited_behavior:
  - decision:implicit-document-shell wraps every page in the registered document, so a page template holds page content only
  - decision:automatic-async-render-selection decides streaming from the generated HasAwaitBlock flag, exactly as it does for a classic page
  - decision:bot-client-classification keeps a crawler on the synchronous path
  - api:error-renderer and flow:error-template-generation answer a decode or render failure with the project error pages
  - policy:public-asset-negotiation encoding and requirement:external-boundary-runtime script reference come with the shell
mux_parameter:
  narrow_problem: api:serve-mux is a type alias of net/http.ServeMux in every build without the tinygo or decision:force-tinygo-logic tag, so the two mux types are one type on the host and a concrete signature only fails when building for TinyGo
  chosen: a one-method router interface named by MuxType, which the built-in registry template writes verbatim
  rejected:
    generics: a generic Register over a constrained type parameter, which the registry template has no type parameter slot for and would therefore cost a whole-file replacement; the boxing it avoids happens once per route at startup, and MuxType already gives the named exported contract that was the real argument for it
    concrete_pw_servemux: correct wherever the alias collapses, but mismatched in a host build carrying the force_tinygo_logic tag
  precedent: pw already accepts either mux structurally where it checks operational endpoint collisions, asserting the Handler method rather than a concrete mux type
rationale:
  - a page and a classic handler that render differently would double every response policy the framework already owns
  - keeping every generation template at its default means an upstream fix or improvement arrives without a merge
non_goals:
  - exposing the emitter or its templates to applications
  - a project-level override of a generated file name
```
