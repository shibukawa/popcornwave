title: Highlight Without a Server First
---
Stage 1 of vision:editor-support is a TextMate grammar and nothing else, so highlighting works in a freshly opened file with no binary, no project, and no configuration.

```yaml
status: proposed
problem:
  - semantic tokens are more accurate but arrive only after a server starts, a project loads, and a document syncs
  - a .pw.html opened from a code review checkout, a dependency, or a gist has no project at all
decision:
  stage_1: contributes.grammars only, per requirement:template-syntax-highlighting
  later: semantic tokens from requirement:pw-language-server refine the same file, never replace the grammar
accepted_inaccuracy:
  - the grammar cannot tell a declared parameter from any other identifier, so both highlight as an identifier
  - the grammar cannot verify that {/if} closes an {if}, so an unbalanced body degrades to plain text rather than to an error
  - an expression spanning lines inside an attribute value may lose its scope, because the engine is line-oriented
  - a type name and a component name are both PascalCase and are not distinguished
rule: an inaccuracy is acceptable when the worst case is missing color; a grammar that colors invalid source as valid, or valid source as an error, is not
reason:
  - the request that opened vision:editor-support is highlighting, and this is the whole of it
  - zero runtime dependency means zero startup failure mode, which is the entire cost of stage 1
  - system:vscode embeddedLanguages already gives bracket matching and comment toggling inside the HTML and SQL bodies for free
consequences:
  - the grammar duplicates knowledge system:tinybind owns, guarded by rule:template-grammar-scopes
  - no diagnostic, completion, or navigation exists at stage 1, and the extension must not imply otherwise
  - semantic token scopes must be chosen to layer over the grammar scopes rather than to contradict them
```
