title: Dual Router Coexistence
---
Popcorn Web keeps the registered router as its general surface and adds the discovered router as a specialized one, and a project may carry either or both because the two share one mux without negotiating.

```yaml
status: accepted
registered:
  home: the handlers tree of flow:handler-registration, whose name does not change
  scope: anything net/http can answer, any method
  truth: the Go source, which api:cli-generate reads per rule:static-route-discovery
  generated: request binding and the OpenAPI document
discovered:
  home: the concept:page-tree root
  scope: GET pages rendered from templates, plus their POST api:page-action-endpoint
  truth: the filesystem, from which api:cli-generate writes the Go
  generated: components, decoders, and the api:page-registry ServeMux registration
  openapi: absent by design, because a rendered page is not a published API contract, and kept absent by the two guards of flow:page-route-generation rather than by the page tree being generated
composition:
  wiring: the handlers mux registers its own routes and api:page-registry Register installs the page routes and actions on the same mux
  order: irrelevant; a generated GET /{$} does not shadow a hand-registered subtree, an unmatched path still answers 404, and a POST to a page still answers 405
  collision: registering the same method and path twice panics at startup, which is the standard library behavior and the failure worth having
project_modes: decision:page-router-scaffold-choice
scope_separation:
  - a page tree root is never listed under data:project-config generate.handlers, so no page route is analyzed for OpenAPI
  - a directory inside a page tree root is never listed under generate.templates, because the tree run already compiles its templates and the flat run would claim the same output with different content
  - server-action is only usable inside a page tree, so a handlers-tree template cannot resolve one
failure_shapes:
  registered: a route pattern that is not a compile-time constant
  discovered: a directory name that is not a legal import path element, per rule:page-directory-naming
rationale:
  - the two routers differ in reach rather than in purpose, so returning HTML from a registered route stays ordinary and supported
  - a page tree removes the walk-and-register loop only inside the shape it covers; leaving that shape returns to a registered route, which is where such a response belongs
  - one mux keeps middleware, api:application-lifecycle, and every policy above the router unchanged
non_goals:
  - migrating existing handlers into a page tree
  - a page route with a method other than GET
  - OpenAPI for page routes or action endpoints
```
