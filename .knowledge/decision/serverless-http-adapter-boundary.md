title: Serverless HTTP Adapter Boundary
---
Keep the application as one long-lived selected-backend HTTP process when a serverless host can forward HTTP, and add a source adapter only where the host requires net/http.HandlerFunc.

```yaml
classes:
  assigned_port_process:
    shape: the application listens on a host-assigned port
    support: native through data:server-runtime-config PORT and requirement:serverless-http-hosting adapter port aliases
  http_web_adapter:
    shape: a host extension translates invocation events to HTTP against the unchanged process
    support: preferred; deployment supplies the extension
  exported_handler:
    shape: the host remote-builds one exported net/http handler with no application main
    support: generated source adapter over pw.Middlewares or pwfast.Start plus pwfast.NetHTTPHandler in requirement:serverless-source-entrypoints
  event_function:
    shape: a provider-specific event and response ABI
    support: deferred until one adapter can preserve the complete HTTP contract
  edge_wasm:
    shape: a fetch or WASI HTTP ABI rather than net/http
    support: Cloudflare is targeted by requirement:cloudflare-workers-hosting through a fetch-to-net/http adapter; component-model hosts remain deferred by decision:wasi-http-deferred
principles:
  - do not reimplement a provider Runtime API when a maintained HTTP adapter preserves the existing server
  - provider assignment overrides the configured listener port because the host sends traffic there regardless of config.prod.toml
  - deployment credentials, resource creation, routing, domains, and secrets remain provider tooling concerns
  - target names the provider; backend names nethttp or fasthttp; neither axis aliases the other
```
