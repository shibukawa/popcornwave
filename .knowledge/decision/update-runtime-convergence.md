title: Update Runtime Convergence
---
system:tinybind v0.3.0 ships htmlupdate, a complete update transport with its own browser runtime, header namespace, and endpoint prefix, duplicating what Popcorn Web already owns; adopt it as the transport and merge the two browser runtimes into one asset under the existing Popcorn Web names rather than retiring either side.

```yaml
source: user convergence decision 2026-08-01
what_upstream_now_ships:
  package: tinybind-go/htmlupdate, the net/http half htmlbind deliberately excludes so generated plans stay TinyGo-safe
  modes: navigation delta, component redraw, action response, streamed delta records, live reconnect
  runtime: one embedded runtime.js served from its own versioned path
  names: from v0.3.1 every name is configuration reaching both halves as one object, so nothing this framework calls carries the dependency's brand
  serving: the module serves its own asset by default and stops when the caller declares ownership
what_pw_already_owned:
  runtime: the boundary runtime of requirement:external-boundary-runtime, serving async completion apply, live delivery, and truncation reload
  header: the live mode token on Pw-Response-Mode
  path: the reserved prefix of requirement:framework-script-assets
  framing: the envelopes of api:html-boundary-protocol
overlap: async streaming, live delivery, and reconnect exist on both sides; navigation delta, redraw, action response, form reconciliation, and preserved islands exist only upstream
decision:
  transport: htmlupdate is the implementation, wrapped by api:html-update-options; pw writes no delta encoder, no manifest codec, and no redraw router of its own
  header_namespace: one Pw prefix, so the render header is Pw-Render and the hint headers are Pw-Manifest and Pw-Build
  one_header_many_modes: the live token joins the same header as a mode value rather than keeping a header of its own, because the modes are mutually exclusive readings of one question
  runtime_asset: the two scripts merge into one popcornweb-runtime.js, served by requirement:unified-update-runtime from the reserved prefix
  endpoints: htmlupdate mounts under the pw reserved prefix, so requirement:framework-script-assets keeps one routing, caching, and access rule
why_coexistence_works:
  negotiate_is_strict: htmlupdate resolves anything that is not its own mode token to a complete document, so an unrecognized value is inert rather than an error
  consequence: a live token on the shared header reaches htmlupdate as no update request at all
  ordering_rule: pw must test its own modes before delegating, or a live request would be answered as a document; this is the one thing the shared header costs
  version_suffix: the live token gains the ;v=N form the other modes carry, so one parser reads the header
  token_shared_with_a_planned_mode: the module publishes 'live;v=N' in its guide for its own live reconnect, but parses no live token and carries live deliveries on the navigation mode instead, so the two describe the same intent with different bodies; requirement:tinybind-update-composition-seams carries the convergence
retired:
  - the separate boundary runtime file, absorbed rather than deleted
not_actually_retired:
  what: Pw-Response-Mode was to be replaced by a mode value on the shared header, and it was not; the live path still selects on it, both in the server entry and in this framework's own boundary runtime
  found: 2026-08-04, while adopting v0.3.5
  harmless_today: the two headers do not collide, and the module's own live token on the shared header reaches a path this framework does not read, so nothing is misrouted
  but: the ordering rule this decision calls the one cost of a shared header is therefore paying for a merge that has not happened
  settles_with: the client ownership work, now done, since one side writing both halves makes a single header a choice rather than a negotiation
kept:
  - every envelope of api:html-boundary-protocol, since the async and live paths are unchanged on the wire
  - api:live-delivery-protocol records and the document end marker
  - the reserved-path and immutable-revision rules of requirement:framework-script-assets
upstream_request:
  raised: requirement:tinybind-runtime-ownership, ten findings against v0.3.0
  answered: v0.3.1, every item accepted, which removes every workaround this decision had allowed for
  effect_here: the merge becomes composition of an exported value instead of vendoring a copy, and every name becomes configuration instead of a rebuild
resolved_asks:
  runtime_source: exported as bytes, as an asset with a digest and media type, and as a configuration the server and browser share; serving is switchable, so this framework serves the merged asset alone
  protocol_names: the runtime reads the attribute prefix, header namespace, endpoint prefix, and installed name from that configuration, so the Pw namespace needs no rebuilt runtime
  author_attributes: the preserve and ignore markers follow the same prefix, so no application template writes the dependency's name
  boundary_prefix: one render option names the placeholder element and the boundary ids together, so the generated attributes and the rendered markup finally agree
  mount: takes a one-method router that api:serve-mux already satisfies, so the endpoints install with one call
  errors: a typed failure reaches a callback, so a redraw failure is visible to api:error-renderer and the request-scoped logger
  registration_and_bounds: registration returns an error, options validate together, and the query bound and stream media type are configurable
how_pw_holds_its_own_half:
  today: a Go const holding the script as a raw string literal, with tests asserting over that string
  cost: the JavaScript gets no editor tooling, no formatter, and no linter, and a merged asset several times its size makes that worse
  change: hold it as a real .js file embedded at build time, so both halves of the merge are files before they are bytes
script_tag_ownership: pw emits its own tag, because injection per decision:runtime-tag-injection is what keeps the reference out of an author-owned file; upstream returns an empty tag once the caller owns the runtime, so the two do not collide
rejected:
  keep_pw_runtime_only:
    what: implement navigation delta, redraw, and action apply on the htmlbind boundary and validator primitives
    why_not: it rewrites form-state reconciliation, preserved islands, history, scroll, and focus handling that upstream already ships and tests
    under_review: 2026-08-04, per the client ownership entry of requirement:tinybind-update-composition-seams
    what_the_estimate_missed: the cost of the coupling itself, counted here as zero; wiring the redraw endpoint found that the module's browser half decides the address of an endpoint this framework serves, so a change this framework could make alone needs a coordinated round instead
    what_it_got_right: the size of what would be rewritten, which the audit confirmed rather than reduced
    not_reversed_yet: the trade is now between a known rewrite and a coupling that bills per round, and that is the argument the next round settles
    decided: 2026-08-04, that every byte running in a browser becomes this framework's; v0.3.5 made the module's asset opt-in, so what remained was writing the replacement rather than negotiating for the right to
    narrowed_by_v0_3_5: the coupling that forced the decision was addressing, and that is now the caller's, so the rewrite was taken because it was worth taking rather than to unblock anything
    done: the client half is this framework's, written against the published wire contract rather than derived from the module's implementation
    what_it_cost: about four hundred and fifty lines, against an estimate that had counted the rewrite correctly and the coupling at zero
    what_it_bought: one apply core instead of two, one live implementation instead of two, addressing this framework can change alone, and a conformance harness that tests the wire rather than a JavaScript entry surface
    what_stays_the_module_s: every Go half, and everything the compiler emits; the transport decision above is unchanged
  adopt_upstream_names:
    what: serve under X-Tinybind and /_tb
    why_not: the reserved prefix, the immutable revision URL, and the framework-owned asset rule are Popcorn Web contracts a dependency name must not leak into
  two_runtimes_on_one_page:
    why_not: two boundary id spaces, two script tags, and two build identities on one document, with nothing deciding which one owns a given region
sequencing:
  - api:html-update-options and requirement:unified-update-runtime, since every other item loads through them
  - requirement:navigation-delta-rendering, which needs no generation change
  - requirement:reloadable-component-endpoint, which needs the reloadable modifier and a registration site
  - requirement:action-response-update, which needs only a branch in an application handler
  - requirement:module-native-csrf, whose token supply and middleware are this framework's remaining half
delivery_of_the_runtime_itself: decision:runtime-tag-injection, which is a prerequisite of the first item rather than a step after it, because a merged asset no page reliably loads is worth nothing
not_sequenced_here: requirement:component-asset-extraction, which concerns application component assets and shares nothing with this convergence but the word script
unblocks: flow:partial-refresh, the rung decision:web-runtime-delivery-order placed after flow:initial-streaming-render
```
