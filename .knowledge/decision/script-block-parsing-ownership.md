title: Script Block Parsing Ownership
---
Parse the component script block in this framework rather than in system:tinybind, and hand the result back as a compile option, so the module keeps its position that it reads no JavaScript and the upstream ask stops being an agreement.

```yaml
source: decision:component-handler-namespace, requirement:component-script-event-binding, and the user's ownership question 2026-08-11
review_gate: accepted upstream 2026-08-12
shipped: system:tinybind v0.5.8 built the seam as asked; ComponentScripts reports the block, its position, the names the markup referenced and the declared parameters, and routetree takes a ScriptResolver answering both maps
what_the_module_kept: its position that it reads no JavaScript, stated in the reporting type's own documentation as the reason the seam exists
what_the_parse_produces:
  handler_names: the keys of the object setup returns, which is what a name in an on-attribute resolves against
  prop_names: the parameter pattern setup destructures, which is what decides the values emitted onto the component root
why_it_looked_like_an_upstream_change: both answers are consumed by emission, and only system:tinybind emits component markup, so the natural reading was that the parser had to live where the emitter does
the_seam_already_exists:
  precedent: the server-action dataflow of system:tinybind, where the compiler reports referenced names in one pass, the caller resolves them against its own knowledge, and the resolved map returns as a compile option to be lowered into markup
  second_precedent: the external action resolution that lets a framework supply an address for a name the route tree does not hold
  third_precedent: the reference hook, which is a caller-supplied Go func called inside the generator process
  therefore: a caller answering a question the compiler asks mid-generation is an established shape here rather than a new one
chosen:
  parse_here: this framework reads the block and computes both sets
  upstream_asks_and_lowers: the compiler reports the block and the referenced names, takes the resolved sets as an option, and emits accordingly
  what_it_removes: the reversal of the module's standing position that it reads no JavaScript, which was the one item on the list needing agreement rather than work
why_this_is_the_right_side_of_the_line:
  the_browser_story_is_already_ours: system:tinybind put the browser script with the caller, and the block is authored browser code, so reading it is on the same side of a line that already exists
  dependency_weight: a JavaScript tokenizer in the module would be carried by every consumer of its config, sql, dynamo and firestore halves, none of which have a browser; here it is carried by the framework whose feature it is
  iteration: the parser will be wrong about real code at first, and fixing it here needs no upstream release
  ownership_of_the_conventions: setup, its argument and the teardown convention are already stated upstream to be the caller's, so the names this parser looks for are ours to change
diagnostics_stay_positioned:
  problem: an error must name the template position of the attribute and the block it failed against, and positions belong to the compiler
  answer: the resolved map carries an unresolved marker rather than an omission, so the compiler reports with the position it holds and this framework supplies the reason
  precedent: the dynamic-value report of the reference hook already reports from the compiler about something the caller decided
reading_the_block_without_being_told:
  possible: the block is delimited in the template source and this framework already reads project sources for route discovery
  rejected: duplicating the raw-text boundary rules is a drift risk, and the extracted asset exists only after the compile that needed the answer
  therefore: the compiler reporting the block text in the first pass is the cheaper half of the ask
what_stays_upstream_regardless:
  attribute_reservation: only the grammar can reserve a name and lower it away, which is true of on-attributes exactly as it is of server-action
  markup_emission: the props attribute and the lowered event attribute are markup, and the module writes markup
  the_form_lowering: emitting a real action and method beside the runtime attribute is a lowering-set question, per decision:action-entry-point-selection
constraints:
  - the parser never rewrites the block, so the content-hashed single file of requirement:component-asset-extraction is unaffected
  - a project declaring no script block runs no parser and regenerates identically
  - the parse is generation-time only, so TinyGo targets are untouched on either side
the_request_is_written: docs/tinybind-go-actions-and-handlers-request.md, which states the four asks, their inputs and outputs, and the non-asks in the terms this decision sets
open_questions:
  - whether a second framework building on system:tinybind would then have to write its own parser, and whether that argues for the module absorbing this once a second one exists
```
