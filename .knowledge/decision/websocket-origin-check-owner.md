title: This Framework Decides Which Origin May Open A Socket
---
Wire the socket's origin check to internal/requestorigin rather than leaving the module's host comparison in place, because an upgrade request carries cookies, never reaches the CSRF middleware, and is the one request whose cross-site judgement this deployment already answers somewhere else.

```yaml
status: implemented 2026-08-11, per requirement:typed-websocket
hazard:
  what: cross-site WebSocket hijacking
  why_it_is_not_covered_today: policy:csrf-protection guards unsafe methods, and a handshake is a GET, so the middleware lets it through before the upgrade happens
  what_makes_it_worse_than_a_form_post: the connection persists, so one accepted handshake is an open channel rather than one request
what_the_module_supplies:
  shape: "func(origin, host string) bool, per system:tinybind-websocket"
  default: refuse when Origin is present and its host differs from Host, admit when it is absent
  what_it_cannot_see:
    - the scheme, so it compares hosts alone
    - a forwarded host or proto, so a deployment behind decision:local-tls-proxy-boundary is judged on what the proxy put in Host
    - security.csrf.trusted_origins, so an origin this deployment declared acceptable is refused anyway
  verdict: correct as a library default and wrong as this framework's answer, since the framework has a resolver and the module does not
chosen:
  who_decides: pw and pwfast build the CheckOrigin closure and hand it to the module, so the module still writes the refusal and this framework still makes the judgement
  comparison:
    is: requestorigin.MatchesOrigin unchanged, the same function policy:csrf-protection and api:authentication-endpoints call
    decided_by: owner, 2026-08-11, over a scheme-insensitive comparison written for upgrades alone
    scheme_is_compared: because that is what the shared function does, and a socket-only relaxation would be a second cross-site rule to keep aligned with the first
    referer_argument_is_empty: a handshake has no navigation behind it, so the fallback that exists for a stripped Origin has nothing to read
    price: "decision:ingress-tls-termination leaves r.TLS nil on every request, so an https deployment resolves its own origin as http until server.trusted_proxies names the peer, and every browser upgrade is refused until it does"
    why_that_price_is_accepted: policy:csrf-protection already demands the same declaration, and requirement:proxied-request-identity classes that failure as loud — found at the first deployment rather than in production
    local_development_unaffected: nothing terminates TLS in the serving path, so a local origin is http on both sides and matches
  self_origin: "proxies.OriginOf(host, scheme) with the scheme from SchemeOf, which is what pwfast/csrf.go and middlewares/csrf.go already do per requirement:proxied-request-identity"
  trusted_set: "requestorigin.Set(security.csrf.trusted_origins), reused rather than given a list of its own, because two allowlists for one cross-site question are two chances to declare one and forget the other"
  captured_when: at the entry, in handler scope, since the callback may not read the request afterwards
  override: the per-call SocketOptions CheckOrigin still wins, for the endpoint whose policy is genuinely its own
absent_origin_is_admitted:
  rule: no Origin header means the caller is not a browser, and the handshake is admitted
  why_not_the_csrf_rule: MatchesOrigin refuses a request carrying neither Origin nor Referer, which is right for a form post and would refuse every non-browser socket client
  why_it_is_safe: RFC 6455 requires a browser client to send Origin and permits only a non-browser client to omit it, so an absent header cannot be a page on another site
  read_from: the specification, not measured
  what_protects_the_rest: authentication, which a non-browser client has to carry anyway and which the origin check was never the guard for
  null_origin_is_not_absent: an opaque origin sends the literal null, which is a browser, and it is refused; MatchesOrigin already answers this way and the rule is written down so the behaviour cannot drift into a pass
  referer_is_not_read: a handshake has no navigation behind it, so the fallback that exists for a stripped Origin has nothing to fall back to
shape:
  order: an absent Origin is admitted first, then MatchesOrigin decides the rest
  reading: the two are not in tension; the comparison is unchanged, and what precedes it is the rule about which callers are subject to a comparison at all
no_settings_published:
  decided_by: owner, 2026-08-11
  when: a handler test, or a mux assembled without a parse; pwconfig.Parse and buildRuntimeHandler both publish, so no served application reaches this
  chosen: refuse outside development, fall back to the module's host comparison inside it
  seam: pwconfig.Development, the same relaxation gate every other development-only behaviour reads
  why_not_refuse_everywhere: it would fail every handler unit test that never built a chain, for a reason with nothing to do with what the test asserts
  why_not_degrade_everywhere: a deployment with no published settings has no framework answer, and serving an unchecked upgrade silently is the failure this decision exists to prevent
  unset_app_env_counts_as_development: per pwconfig.Development, whose exposure is already carried by the startup warning EnvironmentDeclared drives rather than by a second one here
  admitted_cost: the branch a test exercises is not the branch a deployment runs; it is bounded to the case where nothing published settings, which a deployment cannot be in
consequences:
  - a proxied deployment that configured security.csrf.trusted_origins gets a working socket with nothing further to declare, which is the asymmetry requirement:proxied-request-identity found between csrf and auth and did not want repeated here
  - the refusal stays the module's 403 problem document, so a refused upgrade looks like every other refusal
  - the check reads two headers and a resolved origin per handshake, which is once per connection rather than once per message
```
