title: Buffered Fragment Delivery
---
api:html-fragment-response always buffers; a fragment response never streams await boundaries.

```yaml
status: accepted
rule: render with the blocking entry point, so the body is settled markup before any byte leaves
why:
  parser_framing: the marker envelope of api:html-boundary-protocol is only valid where the browser parser consumes the response, and a swap library reads the body with fetch, where a marker connects to nothing
  insertion_owner: the fetch envelope works because the framework holds the bytes and namespaces placeholder ids as it inserts; here the swap library inserts, so neither guarantee exists
  no_stray_ids: the blocking await path writes the settled subtree in place and emits no tb-boundary element at all, so a fragment carries no placeholder and no id that could duplicate one already live in the document
  no_runtime: with no placeholder there is nothing for requirement:external-boundary-runtime to apply, so a fragment route works in a page that never loaded it
configuration:
  html.async_timeout: applied as a render deadline, the per-render shape policy:async-render-bounds describes for the buffered branch
  html.streaming: not read, since this path has one branch
  html.bot_detection: not read, since one representation needs no api:client-classification
cost:
  fact: a slow await inside a fragment delays the whole swap and shows no fallback
  bound: the render deadline above, after which a recover clause renders or the response becomes a 500
  mitigation: keep slow work out of a fragment leaf, or let flow:partial-refresh deliver it progressively
future: a streaming fragment belongs on the fetch envelope of flow:partial-refresh, which already owns ordering, ids, and application into a live document
```
