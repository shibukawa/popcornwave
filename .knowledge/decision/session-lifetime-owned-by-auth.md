title: Session Lifetime Owned by Authentication
---
Every session duration is declared under `[auth]`, because an expiry is a statement about how long a proof of identity stays good, and the store holding the bytes has no basis to make it.

```yaml
status: accepted
moved:
  from: data:session-runtime-config
  to: data:authentication-runtime-config
  keys: ttl, idle_timeout, and renewal_interval, which become auth.session.ttl, auth.session.idle_timeout, and auth.session.renewal_interval
  joined_by: the auth.recent_auth_max_age and auth.assurance keys already there
reason:
  same_question: an absolute expiry, an idle expiry, and a re-proof window are three answers to how long a proof stays good, so splitting them across two bindings split one policy across two files
  ordering: a deployment reasons about them together, and a ttl shorter than a guard window is a misconfiguration only auth can detect
  neutrality: the session package enforces the deadline it is handed and forms no opinion about the number, which is what lets one store hold a cart and a login
enforcement:
  unchanged: api:session-manager still stamps the record and flow:session-lifecycle still rejects an expired one
  supplied: the durations arrive from plugin/auth at manager construction rather than from the session binding
  authority: the stored deadline stays authoritative over anything the browser presents, per api:session-store
without_auth:
  fact: an application importing no authentication has no framework session lifetime at all
  token_cookie: a browser-session cookie with no Max-Age, so it ends with the browser
  server_record: bounded by nothing the framework declares, so the api:session-store rdb Prune has no deadline to sweep against
  accepted: yes; a deployment storing per-browser state without any login states its own bound, and the common case imports plugin/auth
  mitigation: startup reports that session storage is enabled with no lifetime source, so the gap is visible rather than silent
  revisit_when: an application asks for typed session storage with a bounded lifetime and genuinely no authentication
consequences:
  - data:session-runtime-config declares placement, cookie policy, and backend keys, and no duration
  - policy:session-security keeps the token and cookie rules and points at auth for the bounds
  - a lifetime change is one edit under [auth] beside the assurance windows it has to stay consistent with
  - concept:assurance-axes keeps its statement that expiry and assurance are independent; they are now merely declared in one place
rejected_alternatives:
  - leaving ttl under [session], which read as a storage setting and left auth unable to validate it against its own windows
  - a two-level lifetime, a browser-session bound under [session] and a login bound under [auth], which doubles the number a deployment must reason about for a case no application asked for
  - defaulting to a framework duration when auth is absent, which invents a security bound the framework has no basis to pick
```
