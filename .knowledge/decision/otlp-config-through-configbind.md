title: OTLP Exporter Configuration Has One Route, Through configbind
---
The standard OTEL_* variables reach the exporter only through the configbind env tags of data:observability-runtime-config; the exporter package offers no second reader of the process environment.

```yaml
status: accepted and implemented 2026-08-14; NewFromEnv, ResourceFromEnv, and their private helpers are deleted and the contrib/otel tests pass without them
problem:
  found: contrib/otel/exporter/otlphttp shipped NewFromEnv and ResourceFromEnv, which read OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT, the traces and logs variants, OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS, OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT, and OTEL_SERVICE_NAME straight from os.Getenv
  parallel_route: the framework already binds OTEL_SERVICE_NAME, OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT, and OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS to observability.otel fields through configbind, per the standard_environment of data:observability-runtime-config, and pwobservability builds the exporter from the resolved config with otlphttp.New
  unused: nothing in the tree or the examples calls either function; the only construction path is pwobservability
  contradiction: NewFromEnv honors OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT, which data:observability-runtime-config deliberately excludes because it counts milliseconds while every bound duration is a Go duration string; the two routes would resolve the same environment to different exporters
why_one_route:
  provenance: policy:startup-summary reports every resolved value with its source, and a value read by os.Getenv inside a constructor is invisible to it
  secrets: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS carries credentials, and the configbind route classifies it secret while a direct read applies no discipline
  validation: configbind validates at startup with field names; NewFromEnv validates at construction with its own messages, so one mistake had two spellings
resolution:
  keep: otlphttp.New taking an explicit Config, which is the seam pwobservability drives and a standalone user of the exporter package fills from wherever their configuration lives
  remove: NewFromEnv and ResourceFromEnv, with their private helpers parseHeaders and validHeaderKey that exist only for them
  not_lost: a deployment configuring by environment variables loses nothing, because the same variables bind through configbind already
consequences:
  - the exporter package reads no environment, so its behavior is a function of its Config argument
  - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT stays unbound, and the exclusion recorded in data:observability-runtime-config is no longer contradicted from inside the tree
```
