title: The Page Ladder Is Two Rungs
---
Offer a page with no Go file and a page that owns its whole response, and stop offering the one in between, because the middle rung's reason to exist moved into the template.

```yaml
source: requirement:template-bound-page-loader, and the removal system:tinybind took 2026-08-14
review_gate: proposed
was:
  template_only: page.pw.html and nothing else
  typed: a Load taking the route's inputs and returning the component's parameters
  handler: a Load taking the writer and the request
  offered_by: api:cli-new, as three answers to one question
now:
  template_only: unchanged in name, and no longer only for a page whose data needs no Go
  handler: unchanged
  the_middle_is_gone: not because it was wrong but because what it did is now spelled inside the first
why_the_first_rung_absorbed_it:
  it_was_never_about_having_no_go: the name says template only, and the distinction it drew was whether Go ran between the request and the render
  what_changed: a template can now name a loader and bind its result, and that loader is Go in the route package
  so: a rung 1 page runs application Go, chosen by the template rather than by a second entry point
  the_name_is_now_wrong: template only describes the files rather than the shape, and the shape is what an author is choosing between
what_the_middle_rung_was_buying:
  deciding: an if in Go rather than in the template, which a loader still does inside itself
  combining: two lookups into one value, which is two bindings or one loader that does both
  failing: a status chosen before the render, which the value-binding hoisting of system:tinybind now gives on a streaming render as well
  the_typed_check: comparing the function's results against the component's parameters, which the component's own parameter list replaces
  net: nothing on that list needs a second entry point
what_api_cli_new_offers_instead:
  two_answers: a page with no data of its own, and a page that owns its response
  the_question_changes: it used to be how much control do you want, and it becomes does this page write its own response
  why_that_reads_better: the remaining choice is about the response, which is the one thing the two rungs genuinely differ on
  the_data_answer_is_not_a_rung: a page loading data picks the first and writes a loader, and the scaffold can offer that as a shape rather than as a level
nothing_is_migrated:
  decided: 2026-08-14, the scaffolds change and an existing page is left alone
  what_that_means: no rewrite, no check, and no diagnostic of this framework's own; a project holding a typed Load meets the module's message when it upgrades
  the_argument_for_doing_more: the shape came from api:cli-init and api:cli-new, so a project holding one got it from here rather than from a choice it made
  why_it_is_still_the_right_call:
    the_message_is_complete: it names the file, the line, the shape the function must have, the shape it has, and what to write instead — declare an external and bind it with a value binding
    so_nobody_is_stranded: a reader meeting it knows the replacement without opening a guide, which is what a migration tool would have been buying
    and_the_transformation_is_small: the parameters become the component's, the body becomes an external, and the call becomes a binding
  what_it_costs: a project upgrading meets a build failure rather than a rewritten file, once per page that loads data
  what_it_saves: a rewriter over authored Go, which is a category of tool this framework has none of and would have to be right about every page in a tree
constraints:
  - a page that owns its response keeps the shape it has, so nothing written at that rung changes
  - a project with no page tree is unaffected in every respect
```
