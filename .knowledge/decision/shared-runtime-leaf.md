title: The Transport-Free Half Of pw Moves To pwruntime
---
The declarations both transports need — the application-facing problem value, the document shell registry, and the error page resolver — move into pwruntime, because two runtime packages holding two copies of a registry is not a duplication but a bug.

```yaml
status: implemented 2026-08-09
unblocks: WriteHTML and WriteHTMLPage in api:pwfast-package
why_it_is_correctness_and_not_tidiness:
  mechanism: generated registration runs from init and calls pw.RegisterHTMLDocument; the other build emits that file with the import rewritten, so it calls the same function on the other package
  consequence: two packages means two registries, and the build that reads the empty one renders a page with no document shell around it
  therefore: sharing the state is what makes the pair work at all, not a way to write less code
  precedent: the module reached the same conclusion for its error types, which live in a shared leaf and are aliased by both runtimes rather than declared twice
what_moves:
  problem_value:
    what: the application-facing problem struct, carrying status, title, code, message, fields, and cause
    found_2026_08_09: it is pw's own struct and not an alias, while the module's problem is a two-field body the error constructors carry, so the two are different types with different fields rather than two spellings of one
    defect_it_caused: api:pwfast-package aliased the module's problem under the name pw uses for its own, which is a name meaning two things; it fails to compile rather than misbehaving, but it is wrong and this move is the fix
  document_shell: the registered wrapper chain, which stores htmlbind wrappers and names no transport
  live_protocol_2026_08_10: the close reasons, the media type, the lifetime jitter and watchdog, the per-client admission count, the keyed delivery digest, the manifest parse, and the record writers, which together are the live wire; two runtimes each writing their own would be two chances to disagree on the one response nobody watches, because it is open while a screen sits idle and nobody reloads a page that looks right
  error_page: the resolver, which is a function from the problem value to a fragment and names no transport either
  observation: every item on this list is already transport-free, which is why the move is a relocation rather than a port
  as_built:
    problem: declared in pwruntime with its constructors, aliased by both runtimes; the net/http status constants come with it, which is the one net/http import the leaf gained and is constants and StatusText only
    registries: both moved, with a swap added for tests, since a compare-and-swap admits one registration and no undo
    unblocked: WriteHTML and WriteHTMLPage now exist on the second runtime and render inside the same registered shell
where:
  package: pwruntime
  why_there: it is transport-free today, verified by no file importing net/http, and it already holds the request-scoped resources both halves resolve through
  not_a_new_package: adding one would make three places to look for framework state where the reason for the move is that there should be fewer
shape:
  pw: aliases the moved declarations, so no application import changes and no handler is touched
  pwfast: aliases the same ones, so an error crossing between the halves still matches and a document registered by one build is the document the other renders
  registration_functions: exported from the leaf and re-exported by both, since generated code calls them by the name of whichever package it imports
what_does_not_move:
  transport_shaped: the response writers, the negotiation, the compression, and the update entries, which are what each half implements differently
  test: if moving a declaration would take a transport type with it, it is not a leaf declaration and stays where it is
consequences:
  - api:pwfast-package can implement WriteHTML and WriteHTMLPage, and negotiate the HTML error page the way the net/http half does
  - the problem value has one definition, so the errors.As that inspects it keeps matching across the seam
  - concept:public-package-boundaries gains a fourth role for pwruntime, which until now was described as what generated code uses
```
