title: traceparent Is Injected By Whatever Opened The Client Span
---
The seam that injects W3C traceparent into an outgoing request is the same seam that opened the client span for it, because the injected span ID is the parent the downstream service adopts.

```yaml
status: accepted
serves: requirement:contrib-otel, whose propagation entry requires extract and inject and named no owner for the second half
implemented: 2026-08-11, in contrib/otel/otelhttp
what_was_wrong:
  extract: middlewares.Otel called it per request, so an incoming traceparent became the parent of the server span
  inject: implemented and tested in contrib/otel/propagation, with no caller outside its own test
  effect: every trace ended at this process; a downstream service started a fresh trace, and the two halves of one request were two traces that nothing joined
  not_a_gap_in_the_parser: the parser was complete and correct, so this was a wiring decision rather than a protocol one
rule:
  statement: the code that injects is the code that opened the client span, in one wrapper rather than two cooperating ones
  why: the downstream service parents its server span onto the span ID it received, so injecting from anywhere that is not the client span names the server span instead
  what_that_costs: the downstream span and the client span both become children of the server span, siblings of each other, and the trace says the handler called the remote service directly rather than through the call that is sitting right there in the tree
  corollary: a wrapper that injects without opening a span is wrong even though it produces a connected trace, because the connection it produces is to the wrong parent
seam_per_transport:
  net_http:
    form: http.RoundTripper wrapping the transport the client would otherwise use
    built: otelhttp.NewTransport wraps a RoundTripper and otelhttp.NewClient wraps an http.Client, copying it rather than mutating the caller's
    precedent: decision:dynamodb-observability-seam already chose that shape for the driver's client, and the deadlineTransport of contrib/internal/authn is the same pattern already in the tree
    consequence: one wrapper serves the DynamoDB seam, an application's own outbound calls, and contrib/oauth, which builds a bare http.Client today
  fasthttp:
    form: a wrapper type around Client.Do, because the transport api:pwfast-package names has no RoundTripper to decorate
    why_it_differs: net/http splits the client from its transport and fasthttp does not, so the decorator position does not exist and the wrapper owns the call instead
    unchanged: the rule above, which is about which span the header names rather than about the shape of the seam
    not_built_yet: nothing in the tree makes an outbound call through that client, and shipping an unused wrapper is the defect this decision was written to remove; the form is recorded so the first caller does not have to decide it
span_covers_the_head_and_not_the_body:
  what: the span ends when RoundTrip returns, so it spans sending the request and receiving the response head
  cost: a streamed or large response is transferred after the span closed, so the span is shorter than the transfer
  why_not_end_on_body_close: it is the more accurate answer and it leaks a span whenever a caller does not close the body, which a bounded export queue pays for; a caller that needs the transfer timed opens its own span around the read
error_text_drops_the_url:
  why: RecordError stores the message verbatim, and a *url.Error prints the URL it failed on with the query string in it
  what_instead: the wrapped error, which keeps the refused connection or the expired certificate and carries no URL
  consistency: the same reasoning as the query redaction, applied to the one path that would have carried a raw value out — the path taken when something has gone wrong and the trace is read most closely
exporter_is_never_wrapped:
  what: the http.Client that flow:telemetry-export posts through
  why: wrapping it makes exporting a span open a span, which enqueues a record, which exports, and the queue never drains
  where_the_exclusion_lives: with the exporter's client construction, not as a URL filter in the wrapper, so it cannot be defeated by a reconfigured endpoint
  built: otlphttp.New strips tracing frames off the client it is handed, on a copy, so a caller that passes the application's shared instrumented client gets a working exporter rather than a silent stall
  bounded: it reaches tracing at the head of the chain; a tracing frame buried under another wrapper stays, because removing it would mean reassembling a chain out of wrapper types the exporter cannot construct
  never_removes_anything_else: an authenticating or retrying frame is how the export reaches its endpoint, so dropping it would break the export in order to protect it
injects_toward_every_host:
  chosen: inject whenever the context carries a valid span context, with no destination allowlist
  why: traceparent carries a trace ID, a span ID, and a sampling bit, and none of them is application data; the redaction that policy:query-log-safety and the query-string masking of requirement:modern-observability exist for has nothing to act on here
  bound: an application that must not correlate with a specific third party gives that call an unwrapped client, which is a decision at the call site rather than a table in the framework
  already_true: Inject writes nothing when the context has no valid span context, so an untraced process sends no header without any switch being read
considered:
  inject_at_each_call_site:
    why_not: it is the arrangement that produces the sibling defect above, since a call site holds the request context rather than the client span
  inject_in_the_server_middleware:
    what: write the header onto some outbound-request template once per request
    why_not: there is no such template, and the span it would name is the server span, which is the defect stated as a design
consequences:
  - requirement:contrib-otel gains an owner for its inject half, so the requirement stops being satisfiable by an unused function
  - decision:dynamodb-observability-seam gains propagation without a second wrapper, since its RoundTripper is already the client-span seam this rule points at
  - policy:outbound-transport-security is unaffected: the wrapper adds a header and does not choose the transport, the endpoint, or the verification
```
