title: Statically Linked goose Engine
---
system:goose is statically linked into every host binary that must apply migrations and is never linked into a TinyGo binary.

```yaml
status: accepted
link_targets:
  pw_cli:
    reason: pw migrate applies migrations without an application binary
    rule: api:cli-migrate is self-sufficient once pw is installed
  host_application_and_test:
    reason: decision:migration-execution-split in-process path and api:test-run
    rule: linked through one opt-in package, never from the pw runtime package
  tinygo_binary:
    reason: system:goose is host-only
    rule: excluded by build tag; the delegated path is used instead
alternatives_rejected:
  own_engine: duplicates version-table, ordering, and dialect work already solved by goose
  goose_binary_only: requires a separately installed tool and loses fs.FS embedding
  pw_only_linkage: an isolated in-memory test database is unreachable from a child process, so host tests must link the engine
containment:
  package: the engine lives behind one opt-in package, not in the pw runtime package
  import_style: blank import opts the engine and its configuration into the binary, following decision:import-registered-session-plugins
  cli: system:pw-cli imports the engine directly because it is a host tool under decision:host-tools-target-runtime
constraints:
  - the pw runtime package must not import system:goose
  - a project that never imports the engine keeps its current linked dependency set
  - only SQL migrations are supported so host and TinyGo paths stay equivalent
  - the goose Provider API is used; global goose state is never mutated
  - the pinned goose version is recorded and upgraded deliberately
accepted_cost:
  module_graph: the goose requirement set enters the module graph of applications that depend on the framework module
  mitigation: package-level pruning keeps unimported drivers out of the built binary
  escape_hatch: move the engine package into its own Go module if go.sum weight becomes unacceptable
verification:
  - build an application without the engine and assert no goose package is linked
  - build an application with the engine and assert migrations apply
  - rule:tinygo-runtime-compatibility passes for both selections
```
