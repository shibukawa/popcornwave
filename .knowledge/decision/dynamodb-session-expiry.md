title: Expiry Is Decided On Read, Deletion Is Left To TTL
---
The DynamoDB session store never depends on a record being deleted; correctness comes from the read check and the update condition, and physical removal is DynamoDB TTL or nothing.

```yaml
status: accepted
decided: user 2026-08-01
two_questions:
  correctness: is this record still valid
  storage: when do the bytes go away
  point: the relational store answers both with one DELETE, and here they are unrelated
correctness:
  read: a record whose dead_at has passed is reported as not found, whatever the item says
  touch: the UpdateItem condition requires the record to exist and to be alive, so a renewal cannot revive it
  authority: this satisfies policy:session-security, where server-side expiry outranks anything the browser presents
  independent_of_deletion: DynamoDB TTL deletes asynchronously and is documented as taking up to two days, so a store that trusted deletion would serve expired sessions for that long
storage:
  mechanism: DynamoDB TTL on the dead_at attribute
  cost: free; TTL deletion consumes no write capacity
  enabling_it: deployment tooling, per decision:dynamodb-operational-configuration
  what_the_framework_does: maintain dead_at so a deployment has one correct attribute to point TTL at, and nothing else
no_sweep:
  rejected: a Prune that scans for expired records, as the relational backend has
  why: a Scan reads every item in the table, so removing a million expired sessions costs a million item reads, while TTL removes them for nothing
  sharper: TTL exists precisely so nobody writes that scan, and a session table is the workload it was built for
  asymmetry_with_rdb: deliberate; there a DELETE with a predicate is one cheap statement, and here the equivalent is the most expensive read in the API
  consequence_accepted: without TTL enabled the table grows without bound, and that is a storage bill rather than a correctness fault
not_blocked_on_the_driver:
  earlier_reading: the missing UpdateTimeToLive was recorded here as a gap holding the store back
  correction: it is not a gap, because enabling TTL was never going to be the framework's job; a production table is defined by deployment tooling, per decision:dynamodb-operational-configuration
  effect: this store needs no driver change to be complete, and the framework neither enables nor verifies expiry at any point
documentation_duty:
  what: the guide states that the deployed table needs TTL enabled on dead_at, and that a table without it retains every session forever
  why_it_must_be_loud: an attribute the record maintains and nothing acts on looks like a working feature
  where: beside the table definition the guide already publishes for deployment tooling to copy
