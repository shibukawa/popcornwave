title: A Typed Action Is Reached By A Call And Nothing Else
---
Let a typed action be reachable only from a script calling it by name, because narrowing the caller is what decides the one question a typed signature could not answer: which response a returned value becomes.

```yaml
source: requirement:typed-server-action, and the user's observation 2026-08-13 that a form-invoked action and a script-invoked one may differ
the_question_it_answers:
  standing_problem: an action owns its whole response, so a typed return has to say which response it is — a value, a region set, a redirect — and nothing in the signature says
  why_that_kept_the_rung_closed: system:tinybind fixed the raw shape on exactly this ground, that a form action legitimately needs redirects, conditional statuses, downloads and streaming, which no fixed return covers
  what_changes_here: a caller that can read a value has no use for a redirect and no document to apply regions to, so with one caller the answer is not a choice
resolution:
  value: the typed one, encoded through api:api-response
  error: api:problem-response
  nothing_else: a typed action never redirects and never answers with regions
  the_raw_shape_keeps_all_of_it: a page that needs those has a raw handler on the same page, and the two are different functions
what_the_narrowing_buys_structurally:
  the_failure_it_removes: a handler answering JSON to a native form submit shows the browser a raw document instead of a page, which requirement:action-invocation-runtime had to close with a header the handler branches on
  now_impossible: a form cannot reach a typed action at all, so the case does not arise rather than being handled
  reading: the header branch stays for the raw shape, where both callers are legitimate; a typed action needs none because it has one caller
how_it_is_enforced:
  generation: a typed action named by server-action in a template is a generation error, naming the position and the function
  not_at_runtime: nothing has to check a header, because no markup can address one
  the_address_is_still_public: obscurity is not authorization here any more than it is for the raw shape, so a request arriving from anywhere still meets the function's own checks
what_it_costs:
  two_shapes_to_learn: an author choosing between them asks who calls this, which is a question they can answer, rather than what should it return, which is the one that had no answer
  no_progressive_enhancement: a typed action has none by construction, and saying so is more honest than a shape that appears to work without script and does not
rejected_alternatives:
  one_shape_answering_both:
    what: a typed action that also serves a form, redirecting when the caller cannot read a value
    why_not: it needs the caller distinction back, and then the return type is no longer the whole answer — which is the state this decision exists to leave
  a_result_union:
    what: a return type enumerating value, redirect and regions, which api:server-action sketches as its results list
    buys: one shape covering every caller
    why_not_first: every author writes the union even where only one member is possible, and the union has to be a framework type in every signature, which is the wrapper the raw shape was chosen to avoid
    kept: it is the shape to return to if a typed action turns out to need a redirect, and this decision is a narrowing rather than a refutation
constraints:
  - a template cannot name a typed action
  - a typed action's response is a value or a problem, decided by generation rather than by the function
```
