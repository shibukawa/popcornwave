title: Test Authentication Seams
---
An application test states which user a request belongs to without performing a ceremony, through three seams chosen by how much transport the test exercises, while no seam that a deployment could reach is added.

```yaml
status: accepted
goal:
  - an application proves its own behavior behind the guard without owning an authenticator
  - a framework test still proves the ceremony, per decision:passkey-test-authenticator
  - the same test reads identically under oidc_only, oidc_passkey, and passkey_only
ladder:
  handler:
    seam: plugin/auth/authtest builds a context already carrying an authenticated data:request-authentication
    transport: none; the test calls a handler or a middleware directly
    modes: identical in every mode, because the value is exactly what the resolve middleware would have installed
    use: the majority of application tests, where authentication is a precondition and not the subject
  server:
    seam: api:testutil-auth NewClient mints a real api:session-manager session and returns a client holding its cookie
    transport: real HTTP against an api:test-run server
    modes: identical in every mode, because a session is mode-neutral once it exists
    use: an application feature reached over HTTP behind policy:authenticated-path-protection
  ceremony:
    seam: api:testutil-passkey and api:testutil-idp drive the real endpoints end to end
    transport: real HTTP and a real ceremony
    use: framework tests of authentication itself, and an application that installed its own api:auth-credential-store or AccountResolver
rule: only the ceremony rung is evidence that authentication works; the lower rungs assume it and prove something else
context_injection:
  proposal: build a request with a context value that marks it logged in
  fact: a value placed on the context of a client http.Request never reaches the server, because net/http creates a fresh context for the incoming request
  consequence: the technique works precisely on the handler rung, where the test owns the server-side context, which is where it is wanted
  server_rung: over real HTTP the equivalent is a real session cookie, not a context value, so the two rungs need different seams rather than one
forgeability:
  principle: what matters is not the carrier but which binary reads it, so the test is whether the reading code can reach a deployment
  context: no client can place a value in the context of an incoming request, so middleware honoring one carries no attack surface wherever it lives
  header_in_production_middleware: every client can send a header, so plugin/auth reading one is a bypass that ships and makes every deployment depend on a proxy stripping it
  header_in_test_middleware: a header read only by middleware a test harness inserts would not be in the application chain at all, so the same carrier would have been safe; it was dropped for being unnecessary rather than unsafe
  redundancy: on the handler rung a header buys nothing anyway, because the test already owns the context
middleware_contract:
  requirement: installing the unauthenticated state must never overwrite an already-installed authenticated state
  today: the session middleware leaves the context untouched on its unauthenticated path, so a pre-installed value already survives the whole chain
  risk: data:request-authentication asks for an explicit anonymous state, and adding one without this rule would silently break every application test that mounts the real middleware
  effect: a test may call ServeHTTP against the full middleware stack, not only against a bare handler, which is the rung most application tests actually want
test_only_middleware:
  status: designed, then dropped as unnecessary
  was: an opt-in middleware api:test-run would insert, reading a per-run identity header behind a crypto/rand capability token
  why_dropped: a real session cookie covers every case it was for, including several identities at once, and it is strictly more faithful because it exercises session creation, cookie attributes, and the guard rather than bypassing them
  consequence: plugin/auth reads no header from anywhere, and api:test-run needed no change
  revisit: only for a case a cookie genuinely cannot serve, such as switching identity within one client per request
rejected:
  - a header the production plugin/auth middleware trusts, per forgeability above
  - a configuration flag that installs a fixed identity, for the reasons recorded in decision:passkey-test-authenticator
  - exporting the context-fabricating seam from plugin/auth itself, because an ordinary production import site should not be able to forge an authenticated request by calling one function
  - making a server the only seam, because a handler test should not need a database, a port, or a listener
exported_deliberately:
  what: auth.EstablishSession, which the server rung uses
  distinction: it fabricates no authentication result; it records a session for an account the caller already decided on, which is the class auth.SetAccountResolver is in, and an application with its own login flow needs it regardless of tests
  boundary: nothing a remote client sends can reach it, so it is not the middleware-reads-attacker-input shape the rejected entries name
placement:
  package: plugin/auth/authtest, matching the contrib/passkey/passkeytest convention
  guard: api:cli-build rejects it in an application dependency graph, as it already does for development-only packages
  safety: the package only builds a context value; the production middleware always sets the same value from a verified session, so no request can carry one in
```
