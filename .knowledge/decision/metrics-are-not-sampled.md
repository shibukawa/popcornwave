title: A Metric Counts Every Request, A Trace Does Not
---
No instrument of data:framework-metric-set is derived from a span, and requirement:trace-head-sampling changes no count of requirement:framework-metrics, because the two signals exist to answer different questions and deriving one from the other would give the cheaper answer to both.

```yaml
status: accepted 2026-08-17
why_it_is_one_decision: the two requirements arrived in one request, and the reason to want either is the reason the other has to stay separate — head sampling is affordable only because counting does not depend on it, and counting is worth building only because sampling makes a span an unreliable denominator
rejected:
  derive_metrics_from_spans:
    shape: aggregate the request span at End into a histogram, which is nearly free because the duration and the status are already there
    why_it_is_tempting: it is exactly one line in a place that already runs, and requirement:dev-request-timing-surface does something that looks like it
    fatal: the aggregation would then count sampled requests only, so every rate is the real rate times a ratio, every average is an average of a biased sample, and a hit rate has a denominator that depends on a sampler setting
    worse_than_wrong: it fails silently and looks plausible, because a ratio applied uniformly leaves the shape of a chart unchanged while making every absolute number false
    still_worse_at_zero: always_off would report no traffic rather than reporting that it cannot see any
  sample_metrics_too:
    shape: skip a recording when the trace was not sampled, keeping one code path
    fatal: a count of a fraction is not a count, and the fraction is a configuration value nothing in the data states
  exemplars_as_the_bridge:
    shape: attach a sampled trace id to a bucket, which is the specified way to get from a metric back to a request
    deferred: it makes the metric path depend on the sampling decision it was just separated from, and the only reader in the loop today is requirement:dev-telemetry-viewer, which correlates a log to a span and has no exemplar surface
    not_refused_forever: it is a non-goal of requirement:framework-metrics rather than a rejected idea, and nothing here prevents it later
consequences:
  - a metric is recorded before, or independently of, any check of whether the span is recording
  - observability.metrics is configurable with observability.trace off, and that configuration is the expected end state of a deployment running a low ratio
  - an instrument reads the value the seam computes, not the span object; a seam that only computes its value into a span attribute has to compute it whether or not the span is recording, which is a cost this pays deliberately
  - the framework's two answers to "why was this slow" stay divided the way they already are: requirement:framework-metrics says how often and how much, and a trace says what happened in one case
  - requirement:modern-observability keeps one sentence covering both signals, and the cardinality rule is shared because the metric attribute set is the stricter subset
  - decision:executor-seam-instrumentation gains a second consumer at the same seam, and neither consumer may change the observed call
what_would_reopen_it:
  fact: a specified aggregation that is exact under sampling, which consistent probability sampling is a step toward
  bound: it would still require every recording path to know the sampling probability, so it changes the arithmetic and not the separation
```
