title: One Trace Context Validator, Two Header Types
---
The W3C Trace Context validator stays a single transport-free function and each transport supplies its own header reading, because the part that must never diverge is the part that never touches a header.

```yaml
status: accepted
serves: requirement:contrib-otel propagation, on the second transport of requirement:alternate-http-backend-readiness
implemented: 2026-08-11, in contrib/otel/propagation and pwfast
what_was_wrong:
  signature: Extract and Inject took net/http.Header, so contrib/otel/propagation was reachable only from the net/http build
  effect: pwfast had no Otel middleware, and an incoming traceparent on that transport was dropped rather than becoming a parent
  already_committed: decision:backend-specific-middleware ports the whole framework set rather than a subset, and policy:web-middleware names OpenTelemetry propagation among the concerns in it, so the middleware being absent was unfinished work rather than an open question
  what_was_open: only where the build-tag line falls inside the propagation package, which the middleware decision does not answer because this is a leaf below the middleware rather than a middleware
shape_of_the_file_before:
  validation: version, hex, length, and the tracestate grammar, roughly two thirds of it, operating on strings and reading no header
  header_access: three reads and two writes, being the traceparent values, the tracestate values, and the Set and Del of Inject
  observation: the split this decision needed was already the shape of the code, so it was a move rather than a rewrite
rule:
  core: SpanContextFromFields takes the traceparent values and the tracestate values and returns a trace.SpanContext or a refusal; Fields is the same seam for the outbound direction
  edges: per-transport header reading, being the four lines of TraceContext.Extract and the fifteen of extractedParent in pwfast
  why_the_line_falls_there: a divergence in the validator is a silent protocol bug that accepts a header one transport rejects, and a divergence in five header calls is a compile error or an obviously missing value
  evidence: the pwfast tests assert the refusals by name — two traceparents, uppercase hex, version ff, a zero span ID — and they pass without pwfast containing one line of that reasoning
fasthttp_supports_the_strict_reads:
  multiple_traceparent: RequestHeader.PeekAll returns every value, so the reject-unless-exactly-one rule ports rather than degrading to first-wins
  tracestate: the same call supplies the members to join, keeping the comma concatenation the spec asks for
  writes: Set and Del exist, so Inject needs no substitute behavior
  checked_against: the transport api:pwfast-package names, at the revision the tree builds against
where_the_edges_live:
  net_http: contrib/otel/propagation, beside the core, because net/http is what the contrib subset already depends on
  fasthttp: pwfast, rather than a second file in the propagation package, because putting it beside the core would pull the fasthttp fork into every build that traces anything
  not_a_build_tag: the two transports are already separate packages here, so the line this decision draws is a package boundary and the tag guidance of decision:backend-specific-middleware does not need to be reached for
byte_slices_cost_one_conversion:
  fact: PeekAll returns [][]byte and net/http.Header.Values returns []string, so one side converts
  chosen: the core takes strings and the fasthttp edge converts
  cost: one allocation per request that carries a traceparent, and none for a request without one, because the conversion happens after the presence check rather than before it
  why_not_the_other_way: a core on []byte moves the conversion onto the net/http path, which is the default build, to save it on the second one
considered:
  carrier_interface:
    what: an interface with Values, Set, and Del that both header types implement through adapters
    why_not: it buys a shared Extract body whose shared part is five calls, pays an interface dispatch and an adapter allocation on every request, and still needs a per-transport adapter, so it is the same two files plus indirection
  build_tagged_copies_of_the_whole_file:
    why_not: it duplicates the validator, which is the one part where two implementations drifting apart is invisible until a traceparent is silently dropped in production on one transport
    sharper: the tracestate grammar is the largest and least-exercised piece, and it is exactly the piece with no reason to know which transport it serves
  copy_into_an_http_Header_at_the_fasthttp_edge:
    why_not: it allocates a map per request to reuse a function whose header-touching part is smaller than the map
precedent: internal/requestorigin, where one question every transport asks has one answer in one place, which pwfast already follows for the HTTPS determination
consequences:
  - the pwfast Otel middleware is a small port rather than a second propagation implementation
  - decision:outbound-trace-propagation gets the same treatment for free, since its fasthttp wrapper would inject through the same core
  - the existing propagation tests cover both transports, because they exercise the validator that both call
  - trace.StoreSpan was added for the same reason the reading was split: the other half derives a context per frame and this transport's request value is its context, so the span is written into it in place and SpanContextFromContext, SpanFromContext, and a child span all read it unchanged
  - the OpenTelemetry root span switch of data:middleware-runtime-config reaches this transport through the published chain settings, so a deployment that exports gets a root span on either half and one that does not opens no span on either
```
