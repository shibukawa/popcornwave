title: Adopting TinyBind v0.3
---
api:cli-fmt cannot be added without moving the framework pin from v0.2.10 to v0.3; the move regenerates every component with an inert update-boundary plan and changes no served byte, so adopt it as an ordinary dependency bump.

```yaml
status: adopted; the root pin is v0.3.5
why_it_is_coupled:
  - the formatter lives in the system:tinybind templatefmt package, which appears in v0.3.1; v0.3.2 added its idempotence guard and v0.3.5 is the newest
  - pw is one Go module, so api:cli-fmt and api:cli-generate share one pin; there is no version of the CLI that formats with v0.3 and generates with v0.2
measured:
  taken: 2026-08-03, bumping the root pin and reverting; repeated for v0.3.2 and v0.3.5
  go_build: clean
  go_vet: clean
  go_test: one failure, TestPagesFixtureGeneratedFilesAreCurrent, and nothing else
  what_the_failure_is: not a break; the page tree fixture is stale because v0.3.x emits more
  rendered_output:
    method: generate a layout and a page against each of v0.3.1 through v0.3.5, then Render and RenderChain them
    result: byte-identical on every version, and identical to what v0.2.10 emits
generated_output_change:
  per_component: a Boundary value, a canonical input encoder, and a BoundaryAttr op, about 20 lines
  who_gets_it: every exported, non-shell component with a single root element, which is the ordinary shape
  served_bytes: unchanged
  why: the BoundaryAttr op writes nothing unless the renderer is collecting an update manifest, which only a partial-update render does; upstream states this in the op's own comment and measurement agrees
  what_it_actually_costs: dead generated code and whatever it adds to a linked binary, unmeasured and expected to be small
correction:
  earlier_claim: adopting v0.3 adds a data-tb-id attribute to served HTML, first said to affect page trees and then said to affect every project
  status: withdrawn, both times wrong
  how_it_happened: the claim was read off the generated ops list without executing it; a plan carrying an attribute op is not the same as a render emitting one
  lesson: for a question about output bytes, render and compare bytes
decision:
  treat_as: an ordinary dependency bump, not a behavior change
  order:
    1: bump the pin and regenerate the page fixture, which is the whole diff
    2: add api:cli-fmt on top
  reason: keeping them separate is still worth it for review, but the first step is now small rather than consequential
residual_risk:
  addressed: the mitigation below was carried out rather than left as advice
  end_to_end_check:
    method: serve GET / from the helloworld example through its own handler test, before and after the bump, and diff the response body
    result: byte-identical, 2014 bytes, with BoundaryAttr present in the generated home component
  still_unexercised: the other five examples, whose generated output is not committed and whose tests were not run against the bump
  examples_pins: every example go.mod still names tinybind v0.2.8 and was left alone; they were already behind the root before this change, and no CI builds them
upstream_requests: none blocking; the two formatter defects reported against v0.3.1 were fixed in v0.3.2
alternatives_rejected:
  nested_module_for_fmt:
    what: put the formatter behind its own Go module the way the extension's WebAssembly entry is
    why_not: the extension does that to ship a formatter the framework has not adopted; inside the CLI it would mean one binary linking two tinybind versions, which Go will not do
  defer_the_command:
    what: wait until the framework adopts v0.3 for its own reasons
    why_not: the reason to defer was the served-HTML change, and there is none
```
