// Package pwroutes holds data:route-table: every pattern an application
// serves, in one record tooling can read.
//
// It exists as a package of its own because three readers need it and none of
// them can import the others: api:cli-generate produces it, api:cli-doctor runs
// rule:route-and-template-checks over it, and api:cli-lsp answers
// requirement:editor-route-explorer from it.
//
// The table holds what was analyzed rather than what will run. A pattern the
// analysis could not resolve is Unresolved rather than absent, so a consumer
// states a limit instead of reporting a clean table it cannot back up.
